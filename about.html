        <h2>My website</h2>

        <p>
            I wrote an article for my employer and they asked if I had any social media to link to. I said, HELL NO. Still, I wanted to give folks a little bookmark to hold onto. I've had a website like this in my head for a long time, but I was always afraid that it wouldn't be perfect. Then I changed what my definition of perfect and now I love my little creation.
        </p>

        <p>
            This website slash portfolio is just as much for me as it is for you.

        <h2>Nick & Nick</h2>

        <p>
            The handle <code>nichniq</code> has a cute little backstory.
        </p>

        <p>
            Duality has always been a very important concept to me (<code>#libra_sun #gemini_moon</code>). For a while, I really believed in the strong separation between my head and heart; my logic and passion; my science and myth.
        </p>

        <p>
            At some point, I wanted to find myself a unique handle / moniker / <em style="font-variant: small-caps; font-style: unset">personal brand</em>. Eventually, I came up Nick and Nick, which became Nich and Niq after some YOUTH took <code>nicknick</code> on the Big Platforms. Nich is the logical one (because it looks kinda German and that's the stereotype I associate with Germans) and Niq is the artistic one (the Q stands for QUEER and there's a silent <code>;)</code> at the end of it).

        <h2>Technical principles</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Make it accessible: screen reader support, no JS, navigable on small screens, etc</li>
            <li>Use semantic HTML tags to encode additional meaning + leverage browser provided styling and controls</li>
            <li>Make things easy to change, avoid entangling things</li>
            <li>Only add structure as needed, don't get too fancy too early, write as little code as possible</li>
            <li>Make the words and the code legible</li>
        </ul>
