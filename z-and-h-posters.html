        <h1><a href="/">Nick Cassleman</a> - Z&H posters</h1>

        <header>
            <p>The first place I considered myself a regular was a cafe + deli my college's neighborhood called Z&H Market Cafe. It was owned by a sweet man named Sam who hired a motley staff. One day, I made a pretty version of an ugly sign they had hanging over the trash cans and asked if I could hang it up.</p>

            <p>I started going in almost every day to work, and I slowly came to know and love the entire staff. I'd go out and smoke with them in the alley; I'd mix everyone cocktails during Taco Nights; I even span my fire staff for one of their nephew's birthday parties.</p>

            <p>I drew most of the posters in colored pencil after first composing the poster in Photoshop and then tracing it. The photo quality of these images is <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">horrible</span> but they are very dear to me.</p>

            <h1>Informational signage</h1>

            <img src="/z-and-h-posters/no-ice.jpg" alt="Please avoid dumping liquids and ice into the trash can. Leave it on your table and we'll pick it up. Thank you!" />

            <img src="/z-and-h-posters/not-one-cup.jpg" alt="Not one cup on this counter please. (A colletion of sad looking cups and plates sit on the forbidden counter, saying 'Leave us at your table.')" />

            <img src="/z-and-h-posters/feed-the-can.jpg" alt="Smoke your smoke... but feed the can, not the kids. Thanks! (A silhouette of a person smoking, painted in smoke-like watercolors. Children hunched over, gobbling discarded cigarettes and saying, 'Better than candy!' A hungry trash can asking, 'You gunna finish dat?')" />

            <ol>
                <li>This was the sign that started it all! They had some ugly sign asking folks not to throw liquids into the trash so I made this one and asked if I could hang it up.</li>
                <li>They didn't want folks busing their own tables so this sign asked them to leave dirty plates at their table.</li>
                <li>You could smoke on the back patio so they asked me to make this sign telling folks to throw away their cigarette butts.</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>Merch</h1>

            <img src="/z-and-h-posters/shirts.jpg" alt="Shirts! Join the Z&H family for $16.00. (The sign is placed over one of the shirts with a frame cut out for the t-shirt's front: a turkey dressed up as an army major.)" />

            <p>Z&H was beloved by the neighborhood and the people demanded merchandise. This shirt featured the Old Mayor, one of their sandwiches, but I always wished they'd make a shirt with my favorite, the Daniel Tamayo breakfast sammy.</p>

            <!-- Z&H family: Sam, Juan, Adam, Tikki, Tikki's sister? that became a nurse (Monique?), Via except her other name, Zoë, Brandon, Frank?, Syd, Tyrone, Taylor?, Jeff, teddy bear beard guy (Tom?), smokey guy that looked like Adam -->
