The book is meant to be an introduction to the visual language of sculpture.

The Elements number fourteen, and range from the obvious: *Material, Surface, and Space*, to the less so: *Memory and Place*. Each Element is illustrated by a large color photo from the history of sculpture ranging from the stone age to the present. All are accompanied by a brief text. The book seeks to encourage the reader to experience the visual pleasures that the art of sculpture offers the informed viewer.

  statement: `
Using the form of a diary, I’m attempting to trace the process of making a sculpture from conception to finished object.

At the close of every workday, I photographed the stone, or stones, I was working on. Then I briefly traced my days progress and the reasons why I made the changes I did. What I was primarily interested in was how ideas evolve, and the place of improvisation in my working methods. What I’m also creating is a record of the past evolutionary process that is usually left behind.
