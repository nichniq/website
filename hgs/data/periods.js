In each of these four works there is an attempt
to connect specific parts of the sculpture with
a detail from a Classical work. I don’t expect
the viewer to make exact connections between
the two. What I do hope is that there is a new
appreciation based upon common aspects,
past and present, with memories that span
time and live within the imagination of the
viewer.

My first sculptures were hammered steel forms made
from flat sheets. These had a remote reference to
organic forms and the human body. I understood
these to be organic in nature and in their reference.
My goal was to move my work closer to the
formal lessons I observed in my study of how
organisms grow in the natural world. The forms of
greatest interest to me had a rigid endoskeleton supporting
a soft otter membrane. For example, the human body.
Regarding the sculptures here, the outer membrane
is canvas, while the interior framework is plywood.

  statement: `
Each sculpture in this series is based on a historic
work. The first one refers to a Metope from the
Parthenon—*Lapith and the Centaur*. Here I was interested
in the implied movement within the waring parts of the
composition.

*The Visit and the Apparition* refers to a painting by
Balthus entitled: *The Room*. The central figure in the
painting holds a piece of drapery that resembles the
angels wing in the *Annunciation* by Fra Angelico. Both
parts are confronting each other, and both are outlined
in each of the two parts of the sculpture.

*Light, Reflection, Space*, is a seven-part work based
upon the *Winged Victory of Samothrace*. The three bronze
vertical sections are facing in and are attached to a right
triangle. They mark three narrow segments of the classical
sculpture. The three forged steel “screens” outline and
extend the forms found in the bronze reliefs. Ideally
the sculpture should be placed within the circular
building seen in the last two drawings. The large
oculus in the roof is open to natural light. That light will
illuminate the space within, thus conveying the memory
of the original classical sculpture through time and over
distance.

Wanting to continue exploring certain qualities
I discovered in the form of the shadow,
I decided to see if I could bring those insights
together with my interest in Greek and Roman
stone portraits. Because of history stone was
the obvious material. But stone was also
interesting because it is, in many respects, the
antithesis to the shadow. Each sculpture
began with a found photo of an artist
whose work was of interest to me. My
point was not to carve a likeness in the
normal sense; Rather, an aura of the
individual recalled through the filter of
time.

These five sculptures represent a continuation of similar concerns found in previous works.
Drapery presented sculptors of antiquity with the opportunity to inject abstraction, and thus
expand the narrative of their figurative compositions. It remains a primary concern for me as
well. This is especially true in Stone Veil where I use white silk and white marble to show the
visual similarities of different material forms of drapery. At times, it’s difficult to tell where one
material ends and the other begins.

We wrongly perceive shadow to be a lightless, flat
silhouette. In truth it is an invisible darkened volume projecting
from the object blocking the light, ending with whatever the shadow
is cast onto. In that limited respect shadows are like the volumes
in my *Space-hold* sculptures in the sense that both have
an enclosed volume at their core. For one it’s space, the other is
darkness. Once the analogy between shadow and space became
apparent, I wanted to explore the expressive possibilities within
the shadow as a vital physical object, my actors in these created
narratives were common still life objects—a knife, a bowl, and a
bottle. These three became anthropomorphic surrogates in my
“stories.”

Inside is a central water garden defined by a circular bench, centered below an oculus open to the sky. At each of the six corners will be one of my stone sculptures from the series: This Child (2004-2008) While these stone portrait heads endeavor to convey aspects of the devastating birth defects and death that Agent Orange exacted on innocent Vietnamese children and their families, the central garden personifies the healing power and beauty of nature. The essence of the Memorial is the opposition between these two forces. In total here is a place where the visitor may meditate on the profound and lasting consequences of each.

// A wedge-like construction half in a forest of trees, and half in the adjacent clearing. As you can see from the photos the wedge or V-like form was defined by a series of poles. At the point where the wedge intersects the forest/clearing, the poles support a curved wooden encloser. These boards have been cut so they conform to a forced illusory one-point perspective that either appears to compress or lengthen the interior volume of space within. The tops of all the poles are cut to define a flat plane relative to the sloping ground of the clearing. Of all the Space-holds I feel this was the most successful, in part because of the scale of the work. Here the viewer can walk within the sculpture and thus interact with it.

I began this series by questing most of my assumptions
that guided my decisions with respect to the *Membrane* sculptures.
For example, I constructed an open spatial structure as opposed
to the seemingly solid mass of the canvas and wood works.
For the *Space-Holds* I used an exo-skeletal frame in contrast
to the interior structure for the *Membrane* works. I did this because
I wanted the interior spatial volume to be clear of all distractions.
Visually open—a container for space. In part it was my early
study of Gothic cathedrals as a metaphor for the Christian faith,
and the spatial problem such a form presents that led me to
invert the “nave,” thus opening the enclosed volume of space
to natural light and the sky above.

This series of sculptures developed from both my previous *Space-Hold*
works and in the forced perspective I experienced in Bernini’s
*Scala Regia* corridor in the Vatican. In both space/volume is either
visually compressed or elongated depending on the position of the
viewer. In this series I continued to explore assumptions
having to do with how space/volume is perceived by the
viewer. Because these works were constructed to act with
and on the viewer scale became an important consideration.
With one or two exceptions I was unable to find satisfactory
sites for these large-scale works. The only sculpture from this
time that I was satisfied with was entitled: *Clearing-Space-hold-
Forest* (1977). At over one hundred feet long the viewer was invited
to walk in, around, and through it.

In many respects these works are a continuation
of previous sculptures in that they are based on
photographic images of the victims of war. The
other points of references are classical drapery,
and in two cases—my hands. The primary
difference here is that I am combining
two stones and I make the juncture between the two
the focus of the work. A simple question is embedded
in each, and it is: What is the difference between
part and whole in any physical object? Sculpture
included. And how do I know where one begins and
the other leaves off.

In the mid 1990’s, at the time of the Bosnian
War and the ongoing terrorism in the Middle
East, there was no shortage of appalling images
of war to be found in books and the popular
press. It was at this time that I decided to move
my work away from the narrow confines of my
studio and attempt to create sculpture that
addresses the pathos expressed in these
photographs. To create work that might
dignify the innocent victims of these
wars. Where to begin? I felt that the plight
of Agent Orange children in Vietnam might be a
possibility as these violent crimes obviously affected
the innocent in profound ways. Once my
point of reference was established, next
was the choice of material. I decided upon the most
traditional—stone. And the focus of both form
and content would be a portrait head based
upon photos of these effected children.

Note: The last part in this catalogue of my work is
the proposed: *Memorial to the Innocent Victims of
War*. It is my hope that the Memorial will be realized,
and these stone portraits will be installed within.
