  <figcaption>
    <p>I practiced aikido throughout college, and sometimes we'd host demonstrations. My teacher (author of <a href="/aiki-waza"><cite data-medium="anthology">Aiki Waza</cite></a>) asked me to make various posters for them.</p>

  <figcaption>
    <p>I worked for UChicago Web Services and we helped organize a data visualization contest for studies. I made this poster to help spread the word.</p>

  <figcaption>
    <p>I took a circus performance class through UChicago's theater department. We had a final performance that we were encouraged to invite friends to, so I made this little poster for fun. Each act was a vignette of some ordinary routine (brushing teeth, cooking a meal) that was made extraordinary via circus.</p>
