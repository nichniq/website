<h2>Me, singing <cite data-medium="song">Stranger</cite></h2>

<p>I used to be veerrrrry shy about singing and performing in front of other people. Then I took some singing lessons and committed to fighting my fears. My mom always sang little songs to us growing up, so this is for her. I recorded this sing-along to <cite data-medium="song">Stranger</cite> by Douglas Dare in a big empty room after taking a bike ride. My singing feels/sounds better after energizing my blood and my breath.</p>

<h2>Piece I composed in college</h2>

<p>I played viola in grade school and tried teaching myself some music theory. I college, I took a music composition course and wrote this for an assignment. My friend Thomas performed it! I'm not sure I ever named it and I've lost the sheet music.</p>
