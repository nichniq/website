<h2>Me, singing <cite data-medium="song">Stranger</cite></h2>

<p style="font-style: italic">uhhmm, i like to sing - i got it from my mom - and i've recorded it like once or twice - and i'm very nervous about sharing this with you - and i know the quality is v bad - and i mess up a few times - hehe esp at the high bit - but, uh, i'm putting it here to be brave. it's me singing along to "stranger" by douglas dare in a big empty room after taking a bike ride (my singing feels/sounds better after energizing myself).</p>

<h2>Piece I composed in college</h2>

<p>I dabbled in music composition software during high school. During that time, I was mediocre at playing the viola and had taught myself a bit of music theory, guitar, and piano. In college, I took a music composition course and wrote this for an assignment. My friend Thomas performed it, and I think he did a great job. Unfortunately, I don't think my teacher thought I had done as great of a job with the piece. I forgot what I named it, and I've lost the sheet music.</p>
