        <header>
            <p>Wowie! Never thought these would see the light of day!</p>

            <p>When I say that I am a poet, I don't mean these poems. I am a poetic see-er of the world, a poetic thinker. I started writing poetry for myself as a practice in expression, not for the production of poems. These were drawn like doodles: personal, imperfect, destined for the compost heap. By accident, I've written a few that I like enough to share.</p>

            <p>My journey toward writing and appreciating poetry is long and ongoing. I graduated with a degree in the liberal arts hating it! Poetry always felt pretentious to me, inaccessible. After college, I invited an old professor, <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/peter-oleary">Peter O'Leary</a>, out to lunch and asked him why I should care about poetry. In an afternoon, I was convinced. Not to like poetry, but to work at developing my own relationship with it. I don't have to like every kind of poetry, just like I don't have to like every kind of painting. We talked about the root of amateur being <i>amare</i>, <q>to love</q>, and how that differs from being a professional. I can write poetry for the love of the process rather than because I'm trying to make something of value for someone else.</p>

            <p>Poems don't have to be a big deal! They can be written in the moment, reworked, and thrown away in as long as it takes to eat a wet sandwich. You don't have to share them if you don't want. You can give them as gifts on birthdays and celebrations. They sometimes live on beats and in tune. They can be found by mistake talking of things without any stake.</p>

                <p>
                    When the universe<br />
                    pours itself through you,<br />
                    open your mouth wider<br />
                    and let it overflow
                </p>

                <h1>Flex and reflex</h1>

                <p>
                    How deep must the flame have scorched<br />
                    That no water could soothe<br />
                    Nor salve could penetrate
                </p>

                <p>
                    That long after, I would flinch<br />
                    When the warmth from your skin<br />
                    Glanced my white scars

                <h1>Between</h1>

                <p>
                    Love is not a point
                </p>

                <p>
                    Love is a line<br />
                    love is a triangle<br />
                    love is a rectangle<br />
                    bent and skewed
                </p>

                <p>
                    No love story<br />
                    has singular perspective,<br />
                    the impossible coin<br />
                    bearing only one side

                <p>
                    walking under<br />
                    frozen trees<br />
                    loose leaf ice<br />
                    rings<br />
                    glass-bell sweet<br />
                    beneath my heavy<br />
                    feet

                <h1>My heart slows underwater</h1>

                <p>
                    I did not ask to wake today,<br />
                    but when I do,<br />
                    I emerge<br />
                    in slow quiet,<br />
                    the breath its own pace
                </p>

                <p>
                    Clarity soon clears<br />
                    like morning mist,<br />
                    burned by the fire<br />
                    of a heart in love,<br />
                    by winds of a restless mind
                </p>

                <p>
                    I bid farewell the peace<br />
                    and prepare for the weight<br />
                    of burdens from today,<br />
                    collecting like burs<br />
                    tenacious and thorned

                    From far away<br />
                    Captured your image<br />
                    And ground it into meal

                    To grow this new life<br />

                    Its deep and steady current<br />
                    Hums above and drones below<br />

                    Doused salt, twilight slate,<br />
