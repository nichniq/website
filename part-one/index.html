  <ul>
    <li>Queer heroism and non-violent adventure</li>

    <li>Creation and wonder</li>

    <li>Questioning and playing</li>

    My notes are spread far and wide.
    Some are in notebooks, other are on various computer files.
    These are on accounts I have with other websites
    and benefit from their tooling,

    <h2>Part ones â€“ and other beginnings</h2>
  </summary>

  <p>
    Early on in the project's conception,
    I wanted to explore how our childhoods shape us.
    Before we can ever shape the world, we are helplessly shaped by it.
    Not just us: all growing things have them.
    Seeds, preludes, introductions, initial conditions, origins, starting points.
    Part ones.
  </p>

  <p>
    In programming, there are concepts that deal with this too.
    Procedural generation and recursion
    both deal with the iteration, repetition, and the growing of data.
    This should make for interesting gameplay and worldbuilding.
  </p>

  <p>
    The also games asks whether the future can influence the past.
    Time magic and alternate pathways make appearances.
    Do our destinies reach backward, adjusting the world around us just so?
    Instead of playing as the protagonists,
    could we play as their fickle fates?
  </p>

  <p>
    The name also begs the question:
    "Part one of what?"
    In my mind, this project is so much better than just a game.
    It reflects my world view, my experiences, and my influences.
    This game is just the first part of my quest to help the world.
    Don't worry: you'll never see a <cite data-medium="game">Part Seven</cite>
    (but I have thought about multiple games and stories for each character).
