  <p>
    I'm making a videogame!
    Right now, it's called <cite data-medium="game">Part One</cite>.
    It's approximately about:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Queer heroism and non-violent adventure</li>
    <li>Nature and humanity</li>
    <li>Creation and wonder</li>
    <li>Perception and knowledge</li>
    <li>Questioning and playing</li>
    <li>Dreams and wyrd time magick</li>
    <li>Trauma and healing</li>
    <li>Origins and growth</li>
  </ul>

    My notes are spread far and wide.
    Some are in notebooks, other are on various computer files.
    These are on accounts I have with other websites
    and benefit from their tooling,

    <h2>Part ones and weird time</h2>
  </summary>

  <p>
    Since the beginning of this project (let's say 2018), I knew I would explore themes of origins. Initially, I approached them via story. The game would follow three characters, born from three different cultures. By intermixing scenes of their childhoods with the present, I could juxtapose cause and effect. How did the character's origins lead them to where they are today?
  </p>

  <p>
    In gameplay, this opens up an interesting question: "How might the future influence the past?" I usually hear talk about choices creating and destroying potential futures. However, if the past is still unfolding to the player, then choices made in the "present" imply that certain things must already have happened or couldn't have.
  </p>

  <p>
    The more I thought about "part ones", the more I found them hiding around the world: seeds, prologues, ingredients, ideas, questions. I saw these as metaphors for opportunity within gameplay, as choices the player would make. By nurturing one outcome, what other paths were sacrificed? Time could be the instrument with which to play with origins and their eventual destinies.

    <h2><q>What genre is your game?</q></h2>
  </summary>

  <p>
    I have a hard time answering questions about my game and its categorization because it's been designed to resist it. Its ever-queer spirit aims to draw from a wide range of genres, disciplines, and domains. The story will feel adventurous, but is it an action adventure? The gameplay will focus on character growth, but is it a roleplaying game? The world will be filled with natural history, but is it educational?
  </p>

  <p>
    Maybe some examples will help. Imagine the following games mixed together in perfect harmony: <cite data-medium="game">Breath of the Wild</cite>, <cite data-medium="game">Legend of Mana</cite>, <cite data-medium="game">Chrono Cross</cite>, <cite data-medium="game">Knights on Bikes</cite>, <cite data-medium="game">Final Fantasy Tactics</cite>, <cite data-medium="game">Braid</cite>, <cite data-medium="game">BioShock</cite>, <cite data-medium="game">Where in Time is Carmen Sandiago</cite>, and <cite data-medium="game">Spiritfarer</cite>. Does that help?

  <summary>Time magic</summary>

  <p>
    I've always loved weird time. I'm captivated by storytelling like <cite data-medium="film">Memento</cite>, <cite data-medium="book">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</cite>, <cite data-medium="book">The Fifth Season</cite>, and <cite data-medium="television-series">Westworld</cite>. It's only natural that time magic would play a big role in my game.
  </p>

  <p>
    If I plan to weave past and present in the game's story, then it asks of gameplay: "How might the future influence the past?" Normally, I hear talk about our choices opening or closing potential futures. However, if we are still experiencing the past, then choices today mean that certain things in the past must have or couldn't have happened.
  </p>

  <p>
    Math and programming study graph theory to help give these concepts structures on paper. You've worked with graph theory if you've ever had to manage dependency and inheritance. Trees are a simple kind of graph, so we might imagine graphs as a multi-dimensional ecosystem that include trees and other structures.
 </p>

 <p>
    I hope that flexible tooling and well-designed code will open new possibilities for creative development. For example, scenes can be created and given variance without fussing with all the plot details and storylines. It allows the author to answer the question <q>but what if?</q> and letting a computer fill in the gaps and help it all make sense.
