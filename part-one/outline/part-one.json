              "content": "# Shakshuka\n\n**Principles**\n\n- This dish is supposed to taste stewy\n  - Cook things slowly, for a long time\n    - High temperatures will caramelize the outsides and leave the insides less cooked\n    - Lower temperatures for a long time will result in more natural sweetness and flavor balance\n    - To do this, cook in a cast iron pan under low heat\n      - Cast iron better distributes heat than other metals\n        - The type/thickness of metal evens itself out smoothly\n    - It helps to cover the pan at various points\n      - Covering prevents moisture loss and conserves heat\n      - It contains the steam which makes sure the tops are cooked too\n- Taste as you go\n  - Experience the transformation of the dish\n- You can make in large quantities without much extra effort\n\n**History**\n\n- Originated NW Africa / Magrhreb\n  - Dated to Ottoman North Africa in the mid-16th century\n  - Tomatoes introduced by Cort√©s during Columbian exchange (exchange of goods between Americas and Afro-Eurasia)\n    - Columbian exchange killed 80‚Äì95% of the Indigenous peoples starting in the 15th century\n  - Mediterranean had access to far-off ingredients\n- Variations exist across the world\n  - Jewish culture: large batch of tomato stew made for Sabbath and used for shakshuka the next morning\n  - Italian dish, uova in purgatorio: tomato paste, anchovy, garlic, parsley, parmesan\n  - Andalusan (S Spain) dish, huevos a la flamenca: chorizo and serrano ham\n- Eaten at various points during the day: breakfast, lunch, dinner\n\n**Prepare**\n\n- Bring the pan to temperature first with plenty of olive oil\n  - Oil adds flavor and helps the first ingredients begin their cooking process\n- Cut up your stuff early\n  - This makes sure you don't try to multitask, e.g. letting your oil get too hot while you're chopping or forget an ingredient in your rush\n- Chill out\n- This dish takes a while but doesn't require your full attention\n  - You'll smell things\n  - You gotta remember to stir it occasionally, so don't do something too involved or removed from the pan\n- Since it's so slow, you can clean as you go\n\n**Cook the foundation**\n\n- Start with onions and peppers\n  - Onion is an important flavor enhancer (it's in a family called aromatics)\n  - Peppers add sweetness and their own flavor that complements the tomato\n  - Cook first so they get soft\n    - The acidity of the tomatoes slows down the cooking of other vegetables\n    - The high water content of tomatoes also affects cooking time\n  - You could add the garlic and spices here or later\n- Add tomatoes after onions + peppers are cooked enough\n  - You can add a bit of water if you want to leave it cooking for longer and do something like work on your video game\n- The longer it cooks, the deeper and more complex the flavors\n- As it reduces, make sure it has enough water so it doesn't burn on the pan\n\n**Spices the dish**\n\n- Strong spices give a lot of character to the base dish, they add flavor, aroma, and personality\n  - Certain flavors and blends also give cultural flavor profiles\n- Not required, so you can omit them for a more neutral dish or one that you want to use for multiple purpose\n- I'm putting in garlic with the spices, but a lot of people add them with the aromatics (like onion) \n- There are lots of spices you can use\n  - Cumin, paprika, and cayenne are traditional\n  - Coriander and caraway also common\n  - You could use red pepper or gochugaru (Korean ground chili)\n- For spices, you can toast them whole or ground\n  - Grinding them before or after allows them to blend in with the stew\n    - Ground spices lose their flavor more quickly, especially when stored long term\n    - If they're ground before toasting, they'll burn quicker\n    - You probably won't grind them if cooking them with other ingredients\n  - Leaving them whole look nice, add subtle texture, and give small bursts of flavor\n- You can toast spices in the oven (not sure about the garlic)\n- You can cook with oil in a pan\n  - You can do this after the first round of onion/pepper\n    - Make a well in the middle and heat them there\n  - You can do this after reducing the tomatoes\n    - Same concept but there's more water to interfere\n  - You could do this at the beginning, but they'll maybe burn\n    - The onions and peppers don't have a lot of moisture immediately so they might not cool down enough and continue to cook\n  - You can cook it in a separate pan for more control\n  - You can add liquid to immediately lower the temperature (like tomatoes)\n  - Don't leave the stove, it'll be quick, like a minute\n  - You can add the spices to cold oil so that they heat up more slowly\n- Spices are done when they become very fragrant and start to brown\n  - They're really easy to burn, be careful!\n\n\n**Embellishments and adjustments**\n\n- Do last taste tests and adjustments\n- After you add the eggs, it'll be harder to mix around and distribute\n- The dish should be pretty balanced: acidity from the tomatoes, sweetness from the slow-cooked pepper and onion, a savory quality from the slow-cooked tomatoes\n- Adjust salt, knowing that it might not need a lot more since it's already so savory\n  - You could even under salt it, knowing you'll add a finishing salt while serving\n- Adjust spices or spiciness\n  - Black pepper is familiar, cayenne is traditional, you could use chili flakes\n  - Tunisia adds harissa\n  - Don't worry about toasting them if you're already at the end\n- You could add meats\n  - Maybe you serve it with a sausage at the end\n  - Maybe you grind up the meat, like sausage, chorizo, or lamb\n  - Consider what kind of texture they'll contribute\n- You could add potatoes and/or beans for more heft and a creamy firm texture\n\n**Serve**\n\n- Poach the eggs\n  - There's a lot of water content so it evens the heat and prevents the eggs from cooking to quickly or coagulating (getting bright yellow and getting hard instead of being thick and smooth)\n  - The faster you poach, the more chance you'll over or undercook the eggs\n  - If you do it slow and steady, the yolk gets very gooey\n  - Set a timer for these, you really don't want to forget, and they won't have any smell clues\n    - Eggs cook pretty predictable, figure out your ideal egg time (for me it's like 5 or 6m)\n    - Lean toward undercooking them than overcooking them (depending on personal preference, ofc)\n  - Cover: steaming cooks the yolks from all directions\n  - Do this at the end so they don't sit around and continue to cook or cool\n- If it needs more salt, a large-grain salt will contribute crunchiness\n- Could add some fresh herbs for garnish\n  - They add color and bursts of fresh flavor\n  - Parsley is nice\n    - Softer herb: not too strong but distinct\n    - Bright green color contrasts the red/orange of the stew and white/yellow of the eggs\n  - If you've got an herb garden, use something fresh!\n- Could add some creaminess\n  - Soft cheese (like feta or salty sheep's milk) adds creaminess and saltiness\n  - Yogurt adds tartness and creaminess\n- Could serve with bread: pita, baguette, sourdough fried in olive oil\n  - If you don't want or have a fork, bread can be used as a utensil\n- Could accompany with mint tea\n- Could serve alongside pickled vegetables\n  - Add a sour element, crispy freshness, fiber and nutrients\n  - Can be preserved at their peak and used later when tomatoes are in season\n- Could serve alongside preserved lemon for a complex sweetness/sourness\n- Could add olives or artichoke hearts or sardines or whatever\n"

Simultaneously, I'll want to start building a UI that can eventually represent those models (and do interesting things with them).\n\nOnce I have the machinery built, I need the data that will flow through it. Where do I get all of unicode characters and their descriptions? Where can I get emoji sets (Google, Apple, Twitter) and are they copyrighted?\n\nI imagined writing a little scraper. Let's say it can go to [`unicode.org`](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html) and download a bunch of data locally.\n\nIn order to stay up-to-date, we can summon a daemon to watch that website for updates and re-run the script to sync the data to the new standard. In some ways, this source becomes a well from which we draw from. Maybe the well fails one day or we find a better one. We just need to find a new source, update our scraper, and continue mirroring the data on our own machines.\n\nPS: While searching for a good source, I ran across a really cool video by the Unicode Consortium, \"[Race is Not a Skin Tone. Gender is Not a Haircut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaucJce8hhE).\" Imagine how cool it would be to have a link to this available while exploring skin-toned emoji."

Their culture, the Fernborn, was founded on ancestor worship and lineage (symbolized by the fern) and has developed wealthy cities in a mountain valley. Their struggles center around choice, agency, and understanding the self (\"me\"). For these reasons, they embody the Enneagram triad ruled by intuition, anger, and the gut.\n\nTo explore Gray's themes of choice and individual power, their powers center around time manipulation. Which of our actions can be reversed and which ones cannot? Furthermore, in a society that is deeply rooted in heritage but is headed toward celebrities of the moment, Gray's time magic enables them to tap into a past (both good and bad) that is being simplified and forgotten. They use the power to learn more about the costs of the privileges they inherit and question what they can do to right old wrongs.\n\nGray occupies a few different spaces. They grew up in a wealthy family in a valley estate. For much of their early life, they were isolated from the costs of their privileged life. As they mature, they descent the mountain and spend more time in the fog and eventually into the caves. Around the same time, they start having vivid dreams that slowly start bleeding in with real life. They run into a group of magical dreamers and learn more about how their time magic is manifested in their dreams. Much of their time is spent in the dream world.\n\nBecause of their family obsession with reputation and status, Gray was very restricted as a child. They were told what to learn and how to learn it with high expectations for success and prestige. They attend the university to study an application of magic. Their parents' strictness cause them to repress their anger, and they fall into addiction while coping with their stress. They are involved with the upper class of the valley and deal with abstract problems of the city.\n\nThe expression of their queerness feels to Gray like an act of rebellion. However, because of their parents focus on reputation, they must be kept private. Their romances are kept secret, experienced quickly in interstitial spaces. Gray likes to push this line with their family and carries a confident attitude, flirting easily.\n\nAs they mature, Gray must test their family's love by living openly as their true self and as an individual, risking dishonor or disownment. To fulfill their potential, Gray must work to learn who they are and what they are willing to sacrifice for individual change. In doing so, they must unlearn the skewed reality they were fed as a child and understand what is normal for themselves.",

They are a member of the nomadic traders and artisans, the Riverspun. Their culture holds a paradox: they are highly traditional but constantly change and adapt to the conditions of seasonal life on the river.\n\nLyric's struggles center around the boxes they put themselves in and the expectations they feel from others. In other words, they care too much about what \"you\" think, and they change themselves to fit that image. They claim the Enneagram triad ruled by feelings, shame, and the heart.\n\nTo explore Lyric's themes of tradition and adaptation, they encounter the power of reorientation. Physical orientation is an important theme for their nomadic culture, but metaphorical orientation will be important theme in Lyric's journey to maturity. In order to understand themselves and the power their ego has in the world, they must learn to see as others do, develop connections, and practice humility.\n\nSpeaking of humility, Lyric excels at pretty much everything they do. They are the golden child, learning quickly and following instructions without question. They obsess over the opinions of others, and they expend their energy attempting perfection. In their early years, Lyric falls into cliche roles in social groups, often choosing work to avoid the work of socializing. As they mature, they learn to make mistakes, express their personal creativity, and push against labels.\n\nThe traditions of the Riverspun apply pressure in many parts of life: gender roles, tribes and families, sexual rites, interactions with outsiders. Because of this, Lyric spends their childhood repressing their sexuality and live in denial, in the closet. After the pressure becomes too much, Lyric leaves their family and wanders around the land, independently working for hire. On this journey, they come out to themselves and unlock their power. To fulfill their potential, they must love fully and openly, showing their culture that traditions can change as much as the rivers.",

They grow up on the Windtamed archipelago, recently colonized by a religious empire after the wind vanished from the islands. They, and their culture, explore the joining of separate things (\"we\"). Those things may clash, they may exchange, they may help, and they may grow. They express the Enneagram ruled by thinking, fear, and the mind.\n\nIn their youth, Haven appreciated a loving family life. They were surrounded by siblings and the church community, working hard to remain faithful to their family and to God. However, the religion forbade queer relationships, believing that it attracted pagan spirits. While attending a religious camp for youth, Haven develops feeling for another kid. They build a relationship that is maintained via letters (the other kid lives on another island). Unknown to Haven, their love interest lives in a village bordering the old forests where many queers find refuge. The proximity to the spirits cause them to travel with the letters and affiliate with Haven. Their parents notice the wild influence and discover the letters and their child's secret.\n\nLike the wind from the islands, Haven's parents abandon them. Threatened with severe and damaging treatments to remove the spirits and their queer influence, Haven runs away and looks for their lover's home. Without the experience or support, Haven falls into trouble and turns back to the church for aid. They enter a religious order, offering submission, and enter a life of asceticism.\n\nYears later, Haven happens upon their old lover. Unrecognizable, Haven is passed over, rekindling fears of abandonment and isolation. They decide to run away again, this time into the forests by following their childhood friend. This leads them to the forest where queer communes are hidden from\n\nEventually, Haven leaves the islands that symbolize isolation. They face their fears by moving into the city where they are surrounded by hostility and religious retribution. Here, they find their chosen family, human and spirit alike.\n\nHaven reaches their potential by learning to find connection with everyone. It requires much work and practice to forgive and take the noble. For years, they expend themselves trying to provide service for others before realizing that they never learned to ask for help themselves.\n\nDuring their time in the religious order, their power was granted through submission to God. However, as they grow, they learn that true power is found in union. They use their spirit mark to create bonds and contracts with spirits, trading favors and making deals. They learn to love themselves and others again, focusing their energy toward build true community.\n",

Notes are separated into three classes; top/head notes, middle/heart notes, and base notes; which denote groups of scents which can be sensed with respect to the time after the application of a perfume. These notes are created carefully with knowledge of the evaporation process and intended use of the perfume. The presence of one note may alter the perception of another‚Äîfor instance, the presence of certain base or heart notes will alter the scent perceived when the top notes are strongest, and likewise the scent of base notes in the dry-down will often be altered depending on the smells of the heart notes.</blockquote>\n\nEach note could symbolize a different part of yourself, with top notes being more public and outward facing and base notes being more intimate."

The awareness of this disconnection is made as we draw more upon our consciousness and energetic resources. This can occur when confronted by a traumatic or chaotic event or loss. In the beginning phases of this stage, our awareness may be overwhelmed by the experience of pain associated with our symptoms or distressing circumstances. As you connect with the rhythm of this stage, you learn to accept and acknowledge that you feel helpless and are distressed, that it seems like nothing works, and that it will never end. This applies to an area of your body or your life. You feel disconnection, despair, or helplessness."

We project from the alienated, isolated, traumatized, hurt, shamed or ignored aspects of our being. These parts try to gain power over our helplessness through external authorities, procedures, treatments, etc. In this stage, we tend to think, ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay if others make decisions for me, as long as they know what they are doing.‚Äù We feel that we have to know who or what to blame when things go wrong. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to know all the details, just what I am supposed to do.‚Äù We tend to project our alienated parts onto others, or others keep projecting onto us. We also tend to judge our experience or others as good or bad, and feel extreme discomfort or dislike for anyone or anything that reminds us of our alienated part. At this stage, we have a definite story about how things are supposed to go and get upset when they go a different way, without knowing in advance that this will happen. As we connect to the rhythm of stage 2, we begin to become aware of our different parts and polarities, and we discover that we are somehow involved in a process. We are partially responsible for our distress."

Our concepts and our physiology have been fixated. We don‚Äôt know why we are stuck or what to do about it yet. The narrative of this stage runs like this: ‚ÄúI am stuck in my body, my shoulder, or back or neck, or particular area. I keep getting to the same point in my healing, or relationship, or life and feel like I ‚Äòhit a wall‚Äô. It feels like I am running in circle and keep coming to the same point. I am so stuck and frustrated. I sometime resent the little kid in me who complains that he/she doesn‚Äôt know what to do.‚Äù At this stage we just need to acknowledge that we are stuck."

We are angry that we have lost our power and are determined not to let it happen again. You think, ‚ÄúI have had enough of this and wish to take my wholeness back. I deserve more than this. I don‚Äôt mean more than a symptom or circumstance. I mean I will no longer lessen who I am.‚Äù At this stage, our focus is no longer on a single cause or answer. It is not about our condition, it is about the courage to be ourselves."

We know there is more to our body sense or symptom than just physical pain. It seems like there is an emotion or an energy that must be recognized. We want to hold our body or part and ask it, ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù It seems as if there is a film or haze between what we are experiencing and a deeper level of ourselves. That divide or membrane is scary, but we have a sense that we must penetrate it, because it is an illusion. We know that past any potential discomfort we will be okay. We must see what is on the other side of the illusion. In this stage, we literally merge with the illusion of self, towards more wholeness."

We feel the tension building within ourselves as this process advances. We feel ready to do whatever it takes to get on with our lives. We have a sense that there is something more waiting for us, and also a sense that we are not yet flexible enough or knowledgeable enough, or just not enough for what is next. We feel hungry for what‚Äôs coming, but in this stage, we just need to actively prepare. The sentiment is ‚ÄúI am ready! I am so ready that I am determined to do whatever it takes!‚Äù"

This may be a discharge of the muscular system, or a fever, coughing, sneezing, or vomiting can be forms of discharge. Crying, screaming, and laughing are also discharge phenomena. When the discharge occurs after the previous six stages, resolution can occur with the discharge. A sense of accomplishment, satisfaction, peace, and inner strength accompanies the process when resolution occurs. The sentiment is, ‚ÄúI am so ready to scream and not only discharge, but resolve the recurrent energy pattern distracting me from who I really am! I am fully committed to do this now. I must let go of this now!‚Äù"

We enter into a state of gratitude, vulnerability, connection with our external rhythms, and alignment with events around us. We welcome serendipity as a natural way of life. The sentiment is, ‚Äù I do things because they feel right- not to move towards pleasure and avoid pain. I do things because it is the time to do them. I know that I will be supported by an abundant universe in my choices. I experience peace when at times my thoughts, inner noise, or static cease. I sense more room in my body for breath. I sense the rhythms within and sometimes around me. I feel gratitude for my connection to others and in a greater cosmic plan.‚Äù"

Our inner sense runs as follows, ‚ÄúI sometimes feel the energy within my symptoms, underlying my emotions, within my spirit. Sometimes I feel the energy between people, and the primary organising subtle energy fields to which my body is connected. I feel the energy in people‚Äôs words, their eyes, or their being. I am more sensitive to love as a basic energy of the universe and find it all around me, and within me. I am grateful for this energetic awakening.

I had had the experience that I am within all, and all of life is connected to me. I have experienced the grace of love as a physical and spiritual phenomenon through light, vibration, or touch.

We participate in a larger circle of life, knowing our gifts and having a burning desire to effortlessly share them with the world, in service. Our inner thoughts and desires are magically and naturally matched by our outer experience. For extended periods, irrespective of external circumstance, I can fin a place and experience compassion, empathy, love, forgiveness, and altruism. I long to serve others with the gifts of my soul.

Our dialogue runs as follows, ‚ÄúAt times I recognize that we are each other‚Äôs medicine, and that first, I must be my own medicine. My life and success in life is a function of the relationships that I share with others. I celebrate and receive divergent energies and help them to join, transforming them into new possibilities and love.
