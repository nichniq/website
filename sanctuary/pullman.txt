{{{ Three Forks

In 5th grade, Mr. Johnson took us on a short walking tour of Pullman. I remember that he pointed out a cave on the cliff below Irving St. We probably walked by the fountain by Neill Public Library and looked at the railroad bridge over the Palouse River.

This small river joins the north fork of the Palouse River at Colfax, becomes the Snake River near Washtucna, and eventually empties into the Columbia River near its bend at the Tri Cities.

Mr. Johnson told us that early settlers may have sheltered in the cave just off the bank of the Palouse River. He said the settlement was first called Three Forks because of the three creeks that joined there: Missouri Flat Creek, Dry Fork, and South Palouse.

Based on light research, there are conflicting reports about the settlement's early years and whether the name Three Forks was ever officially recorded.

{{{ One account of Pullman's founding

In 1875 a man named Bolin Farr, in search of a homestead site, camped beside a Palouse meadow where three creeks were joined together. All night long the gurgling water lulled his sleep and with the coming of the morn, he heard the golden song of thrushes in the willow. “Here,” said he, “is where I’ll stake my homestead, and call it Three Forks Ranch.”

Bolin Farr worked hard to clear his land and plant his crops. Two years later, in seventy-seven, his first neighbors came-settling on homesteads cornering to his own. Thus, the town of Three Forks got its start, though the first post office and store were not established until 1881.

With the vision of a true pioneer, Bolin Farr set aside a tract of land and platted it to town lots, after which he cast about to find a name befitting such a place. George Pullman of the Pullman Company chanced to be a friend, so in his honor, Three Forks faded out, and Pullman took its place upon the map.

{{{ The Palouse

Traditionally, the Palouse region was defined as the fertile hills and prairies north of the Snake River, which separated it from Walla Walla County, and north of the Clearwater River, which separated it from the Camas Prairie, extending north along the Washington and Idaho border, south of Spokane, centered on the Palouse River. This region underwent a settlement and wheat-growing boom during the 1880s, part of a larger process of growing wheat in southeast Washington, originally pioneered in Walla Walla County south of the Snake River.

During the 1870s, the Walla Walla region was rapidly converted to farmland, while the initial experiments in growing wheat began in the Palouse region, which previously had been the domain of cattle and sheep ranching. When those trials proved more than successful, a minor land rush quickly filled the Palouse region with farmers during the 1880s. The simultaneous proliferation of railroads only increased the rapid settlement of the Palouse. By 1890 nearly all the Palouse lands had been taken up and converted to wheat farming.

Unlike the Walla Walla Country, which was solidly anchored on the city of Walla Walla, the Palouse region saw the rise of at least four centers, all within several miles of each other: Colfax (the oldest), Palouse, Pullman, and on the Idaho side, Moscow. These four centers, along with at least ten lesser ones, resulted in a diffuse pattern of rural centers, relative to the centralized Walla Walla county.

{{{ Colfax

I remember hearing a bunch of shit about Colfax growing up. That the guy that Colfax was named after was fucked up. That the KKK had presence there. That the last lynchings in the state happened there. I only just thought to double check that information.

- Colfax was named after Schuyler Colfax, a vice president from 1869–1873
  - He was a founder of the Republican Party
  - He opposed slavery
  - As Speaker of the House led the effort to pass the 13th Amendment
  - He got caught with a railroad bribe that ruined his political career
- There is mention of two notable lynchings in 1894 and 1898
  - In 1894, two prisoners were lynched by a tax-reform group
  - In 1898, it was a white man accused of murder
