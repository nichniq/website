{{{ Native plants of the Palouse

When thinking about what to plant at the Cassleman Santuary, I wanted to look through a list of native plant species. Most of what I found was written about North Idaho by Fred Johnson, former Professor of Forest Resources at the University of Idaho. I think this topic needs more research.
