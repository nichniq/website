{{{ Thoughts on mapping the Palouse

- Remove state borders
- Orient map based on geology, not north
- Waterways
- Oregon Country and historical maps
- First nations
- Weather and seasons
- "Maps" as snapshots of the landscape
- Should show something specific
  - Maps that attempt to represent a static account of everything are lies
