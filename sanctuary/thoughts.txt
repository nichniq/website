{{{ Three Creek Sanctuary for Humans and Wild Life

It's the dream for my childhood home! We can plant a bunch of wonderful things and help build the local wildlife. Maybe it will expand into the Goblin Workshop and the Pahlo Memorial Library.

}}}

{{{ Naming the sanctuary

Why not call it the Cassleman Sanctuary? Cassleman is my dad's lineage and doesn't acknowledge the incredible lineages of his mother or mine. Is there another name or word that is unique to our family?

For now, I'll call it the Three Creek Sanctuary which is a reference to Three Forks, the first name of the settlement. Three Forks because of the joining of the Missouri Flat, Dry Creek, and South Palouse.

{{{ Names related to our house

- Cassleman (our paternal name)
- Sunrise (our street)
- Sunnyside (our hill, the first to get sun in the morning)
- Pullman (our town, named after an unrelated industrialist)

}}}

{{{ Plant inspiration

- Call up native plant gardens
- Get in contact with the university
- Go on hikes to Steptoe Butte
- Go on hikes to Rose Creek
- Talk to farmer friends
- Get in contact with first nations

}}}

{{{ Freshwater ideas

- Create underwater reservoirs to hold fresh rainwater with natural materials
  - Apparently Washington has some restrictions on collecting rainwater
- Small pond in front, stream to back, might be seasonally dry
- Larger pond in back, connected to the reservoir

{{{ Building for today, planning for tomorrow

It's not possible to have everything! How do I decide what to focus on?

What's possible on our just our property?
If we extend to the Schneider's?
To the Haas's?
