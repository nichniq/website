  <p>Wowie! Never thought these would see the light of day!</p>

  <p>If I say that I am a poet, I don't mean so because I wrote these poems. Rather, I consider myself a poetic see-er of the world, and I think poetically about many things. As an adult, writing personal poetry has been a practice in self expression and articulation, not in production. They are my doodles and sketches: personal, imperfect, destined for the compost heap and the garden. By accident, I've written a few that I like enough to share.</p>

    <summary><h2>Journey into poetry</h2></summary>

    <p>My relationship with poetry is long and ongoing. I'll start by saying that I graduated college with a fancy liberal arts degree and that I was a self-identified loather, in general, of the poetic arts.</p>

    <p>Poetry didn't stand a chance against my enlightened and analytical mind. On one side, it was ridged and classical: written by olde white men I'm told to care about. On the other, it was modern for the sake of being modern: opaque, profane, vulnerable to own end. <i>Emo</i>, <i>hipster</i>, <i>pretentious</i>, <i>try</i>-hard, <i>corny</i>, <i>edgy</i>, <i>poser</i>. These were the words that loitered around my wrinkly brainy, waiting for poetry to pass by on the way from school so they could let their opinions about poetry be known.</p>


    <p>I had to change. I called up an old professor from a creative writing class I had taken, <i>Intro to Genres: Wizards</i> (CRWR 12109). It man's name was <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/peter-oleary">Peter O'Leary</a> and he was also a poet.</p>

    <p>I asked him to explain to me why I should care about poetry, and over lunch, I was convinced. Not to like poetry, but to work at developing my own relationship with it.</p>

    <p>He told me I that didn't have to like every kind of poem, just like I didn't have to like every kind of painting or song to appreciate some. More fruitful questions might be "Why don't I like this poem?" or "What do I like about this poem?" Appreciate the poem first before worrying about the poet or their context.</p>

    <p>Finally, we talked about the root of amateur being <i>amare</i>, <q>to love</q>. He related it to being professional. A professional sells their hard work; an amateur does it out of love. Am I hearing you right, Mr. O'Leary? I can write poetry and take delight in its doing without judging and selling every word of it? What would my life be like if I had one more thing to love and share?</p>

    <summary><h2>How many lines are in a poem?</h2></summary>

    <p>In sixth grade, our teacher wrote a short poem on the whiteboard.</p>

    <blockquote data-medium="poem">
      <p>
        He clasps the crag with crooked hands;<br />
        Close to the sun in lonely lands,<br />
        Ring'd with the azure world, he stands.
      </p>

      <p>
        The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;<br />
        He watches from his mountain walls,<br />
        And like a thunderbolt he falls.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>She asked us what we thought the title was; we all took guesses. <cite data-medium="poem">The Eagle</cite> by Lord Alfred Tennyson. <q>How does the title affect how we understand the poem?</q></p>

    <p>In my own poetry, I try to give my poems titles that doesn't appear in the text. I like it when they change meaning of the poem. For example: <cite data-medium="poem">Between</cite>, <cite data-medium="poem">instinct</cite>, <cite data-medium="poem">Leavened</cite>, <cite data-medium="poem">Shade in the window</cite>.</p>

    <p>Titles are helpful in identification, but they also add a special meaning to the poem: context, anchor, mnemonic. They're an opportunity to add unique depth.</p>

    <summary><h2>Poems for many occasions</h2></summary>

    <p>Poems don't have to be a big deal! They can be written in the moment, reworked and thrown away in as long as it takes to eat a wet sandwich. You don't have to share them. You can give them as gifts on birthdays or for celebration. They sometimes live on beats and in tune. They can be formed by mistake, in conversation without stake.</p>

    <summary><h2>Reading poetry? or just writing?</h2></summary>

    <p>I'll be honest, it's still hard for me to read most poetry.</p>

    <p>My poetry initiator, Peter O'Leary, cautioned me against lumping all poetry into one bucket. He advised me to hunt for the kinds of poems I like. He asked me a few questions and then recommended I look into Ezra Pound and Imagism (the same modernist poetry I had been introduced to in seventh grade).</p>

    <p>I routinely name Pound's <cite data-medium="poem">In a Station at the Metro</cite> as my favorite poem. It was recited to me by Professor O'Leary. I guess I like Wallace and Frost and Dickinson, but I have read their stuff in years. I just not drawn to poetry like I am to music. (Counterpoint: What are lyrics but poems that follow a melody?)</p>

    <p>But all that said, I love to write them for myself! I used to say I <q>wrote poetry to develop a poetic nature to my prose</q>. It's hazy and ephemeral nature is the perfect medium for me to sculpt the hazy and ephemeral nature of my deepest emotions. How could I write it in any other way? Certainly if I could, I would.</p>

    <summary><h2>Poetry across the ages</h2></summary>

    <p>Looking back, I've written poetry since I can remember. (I consider memory to be a weakness of mine, so this is not as impressive as it might sound.) <abbr title="To be honest">TBH</abbr>, I think most of us have written a lot more poetry than we might realize, depending on what you consider poetry.</p>

    <p>I'm sure my parents read rhyming stories to me a wee baby. When I learned to write, I imagine myself squirming in delight as I discovered a new rhyme and strained to get the letters to look right on paper. My mom had little Chilean rhymes that she'd sing to us in Spanish.</p>

    <p>In kindergarten, we wrote poetry fill-in-the-blanks style. In first grade, we used our meat machines to follow the poetry instructions and produce a nice Mother's Day poem. (My mom still has the one I gave her framed in her bedroom.) By second grade, we were composing haikus.</p>

    <p>Middle school poetry was weird. For me, it was Evanescence lyrics, Tim Burton, and short English units in modernist poetry (7th) and the Beatniks (8th). Around this time, I had also begun to wrestle with my faith. I rejected the poems that we recited in holy prayer, and I replaced them with poems hidden in spells. My new faith-poems demanded of nature what I had previously begged for of God.</p>

    <p>As a freshman, I learned about iambic pentameter and dactylic hexameter and the other <del>metres</del> <ins>meters</ins>. Robert Frost was taped to the fridge. In my senior year of high school, I took a creative writing class at the local college, <abbr title="Wazzu = WSU = Washington State University">Wazzu</abbr>. My school demanded "senior projects" for graduation, and I submitted a collection of my writing which include a section of poems that I can only imagine described as insufferable and impenetrable. Little did they know, I just submitted the work I had already produced for my college class <code>#doubledipped</code>.</p>

    <p>And then I guess at some point I started telling myself that I hated poetry. Enough of that, I said. How pretentious is poetry, I said. It's not for me, I said.</p>

    <h2>Cascade</h2>

    <p>
      When the universe<br />
      pours itself through you,<br />
      open your mouth wider<br />
      and let it overflow

    <h2>Flex and reflex</h2>

    <p>
      How deep must the flame have scorched<br />
      That no water could soothe<br />
      Nor salve could penetrate
    </p>

    <p>
      That long after, I would flinch<br />
      When the warmth from your skin<br />
      Glanced my white scars

    <h2>Between</h2>

    <p>
      Love is not a point
    </p>

    <p>
      Love is a line<br />
      love is a triangle<br />
      love is a rectangle<br />
      bent and skewed
    </p>

    <p>
      No love story<br />
      has singular perspective,<br />
      the impossible coin<br />
      bearing only one side

    <h2>glass bells</h2>

    <p>
      walking under<br />
      frozen trees<br />
      loose leaf ice<br />
      rings<br />
      glass-bell sweet<br />
      beneath my heavy<br />

    <h2>My heart slows underwater</h2>

    <p>
      I did not ask to wake today,<br />
      but when I do,<br />
      I emerge<br />
      in slow quiet,<br />
      the breath its own pace
    </p>

    <p>
      Clarity soon clears<br />
      like morning mist,<br />
      burned by the fire<br />
      of a heart in love,<br />
      by winds of a restless mind
    </p>

    <p>
      I bid farewell the peace<br />
      and prepare for the weight<br />
      of burdens from today,<br />
      collecting like burs<br />
      tenacious and thorned

    <h2>Leavened</h2>

    <p>
      I saw you first<br />
      From far away<br />
      Captured your image<br />
      And ground it into meal
    </p>

    <p>
      It mixed with yeast<br />
      Time and water<br />
      Growing its own life<br />
      In the pit of my belly

      Night never stills in my city.<br />

      And between it illuminates<br />
      The hours bewitched

    <h2>Lye-slick star</h2>

    <p>
      We flee the breath<br />
      Of winter's languid sun,<br />
      Over crests coerced,<br />
      mirrors red and bright;
    </p>

    <p>
      Through pale gases,<br />
      From underearth, above,<br />
      Seeps darkling din<br />
      Pulled prisms elastic;
    </p>

    <p>
      Doused salt, twilight slate,<br />
      Caught glint of stolen hues,<br />
      Until dawn refreshed<br />
      Spills ink like amber tar

      They pour from my fingers<br />
      from a place beyond my mind<br />
      the cavern much deeper
