- Read article about Maria Montessori: "[Like a Bar of Soap](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v44/n24/bee-wilson/like-a-bar-of-soap)"
	- "The foundation of Montessori’s methods was a belief in work: effortful, concentrated, purposeful work."
	- "Dolls' tea sets were a particular bugbear because they squandered the opportunity to teach children the useful skill of serving an actual meal."
	- "Montessori believed that children were born for _gran lavoro_ – 'immense work'. She wrote that the 'power of concentration shown by little children from three to four years old has no counterpart save in the annals of genius'. The purpose of education was to provide them with an environment in which they were free to work without interference from adults."
	-  "The radical idea at the heart of Montessori’s method was not that children learn by play but that adults prevent them from learning by interrupting them."
	- "‘The adult must not remain on high, issuing judgments and grades. The adult must humbly get down among the pupils.’"
	- "One of the examples she gave was of a boy who coloured a tree trunk red instead of brown. ‘The teacher wished to interfere, saying: “Do you think trees have red trunks?” I held her back and allowed the child to colour the tree red.’ Eventually, after he had spent time looking at trees in the garden, he started to colour the trunks brown."
	- "'The fallen adult must look to the child for salvation.'"
	- "'At fourteen, at sixteen, kids are still subject to the small-minded blackmail of the "bad grade" with which their teachers weigh their work.' She had a vision of a secondary school where every field of knowledge would be brought together under a single curriculum and adolescents could undertake a combination of manual and intellectual labour."
	- "'It is the human personality and not a method of education that must be considered; it is the defence of the child, the scientific recognition of his nature.' Children, she insisted, were the 'forgotten citizens' of the world. To understand their capabilities was to glimpse what all humans were capable of."
	-  "She argued that her message about work – that it gave meaning to human life, that its full expression was possible only in a state of freedom – had implications for adults ... as much as for children ..."
