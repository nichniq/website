I realized I didn't actually know anything about Chris Church beside what I'd gleaned from shit talk. I'd heard (and repeated) that they were racist, homophobic, sexist but I don't actually know how. I started by reading various random articles. I saw some quotes I wanted to compare.

A website run by [The Hill reported](https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/580965-controversial-christian-church-leads-war-against/ reported): 

> “I believe ruling elites are picking a fight, trying to provoke unrest, and are doing so in order to be able to justify measures that are genuinely repressive,” [he wrote in a post](https://dougwils.com/books-and-culture/s7-engaging-the-culture/three-chess-moves-ahead.html) over the summer.
> 
> [In another post](https://dougwils.com/books-and-culture/s7-engaging-the-culture/a-sickly-yellow-custard-that-is-a-little-green-around-the-edges.html), he wrote that government and health authorities “want to be in charge of every detail of human existence. They have a lust for control and power. They are totalitarians in spirit.” He also told readers to appeal for religious exemption from vaccination.

A random news website called [MEAWW reported](https://meaww.com/what-is-christ-church-as-idaho-murder-probe-continues-moscow-is-facing-another-battle-for-its-soul):

> Wilson has time and again argued that the men or husbands have complete spiritual responsibility of their households which includes the obligation of “preventing the wife from failing to submit to his will in spending habits, television viewing habits, weight, rejection of his leadership, laziness in cleaning the house, lack of responsiveness to sexual advances.” He has asserted that “the sexual act cannot be made into an egalitarian pleasuring party”; instead, “a man penetrates, conquers, colonizes, plants,” while a “woman receives, surrenders, accepts,” he argues. He concludes that “true authority and true submission are therefore an erotic necessity.”

Initially, I wanted to put the quote about men controlling the house/woman next to the quote about the government trying to control us. Then, I realized I should confirm that the quotes were authentic and better understand their context.

I found the first one in [an article he wrote in 2014](https://web.archive.org/web/20141023170910/http://www.credenda.org/archive/issues/9-1husbandry.php). (He later [an article responding](https://dougwils.com/books/clunkity-clunkity-clunk.html) to it, saying he was being misunderstood.) The quote about sexual egalitarianism [the quote in question](https://dougwilsonbelieves.com/beliefs/only-men-should-receive-pleasure-from-sex/) is from his book, *Douglas Wilson, Fidelity: How to be a One-Woman Man*.

NB: The second quote was listed in [Doug Wilson Believes](https://dougwilsonbelieves.com/about/), which is a site that aggregates a bunch of his beliefs (with citations) so that people can "rethink if Doug is the right person to be shepherding your spiritual growth, or if you should send your children to be educated in one of his institutions of learning."

In my fantasies, I write an editorial to the paper, putting these indisputable quotes together and showing all the members of Chris Church what idiots they are. However, when looking through Doug's blog posts, I realize there's so much more to the iceberg.

If I want to engage with the situation, how would I do so in a way that wasn't violent? I want to affect change through a change of heart, not telling people they're stupid and how they should be following my beliefs. It made me wonder how much I would need to engage or empathize with them, to genuinely consider their words and try to understand what they're trying to say.

There are probably things that he says that I might see truth in. For example, from an [article from Spokesman-Review](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2019/nov/17/leaders-of-moscows-christ-church-say-theyre-pushin/) :

>Wilson promotes the church’s beliefs in a direct, take-no-prisoners approach to preaching and writing. That approach is highlighted in a recent video featuring Wilson [sitting](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2204476113143961) on a burning couch and smoking a cigar where he says, “It’s not the job of the preacher to be a firefighter out in the world. We’re not supposed to be running around putting out other people’s fire. We are supposed to be arsonists in the world.”

That's similar to my favorite, "We think we are the doctors, we are the disease" quote. I can't fault someone for also appreciating that strategy; but I can still hate what they're trying to turn the world into.

The [Spokesman article](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2019/nov/17/leaders-of-moscows-christ-church-say-theyre-pushin/) also included this quote

> Heather Wilson, daughter-in-law of Douglas Wilson, said members of Christ Church are used to people lashing out at it. Recently her son’s pickup was vandalized for having a New Saint Andrews bumper sticker.
> 
> “A lot of it is remanufactured Moscow misconceptions. People have a habit of yelling things out of context,” she said. “We take care of our kids, be good neighbors, but people always have something to say. People are looking to find offense and give offense when really, at the end of the day, we’re just trying to be good neighbors.”

I'm not sure about the bumper sticker, but I know that there is a lot of hate directed toward Christ Church. Like the Catholic Church, people in Christ Church probably do a fair amount of good in addition to the bad. I don't want the bad, but I don't think it's right to ignore the good parts too.

Again, as [reported by the Spokesman](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2019/nov/17/leaders-of-moscows-christ-church-say-theyre-pushin/):

> “The only possible solution is a massive religious revival,” he said. “Short of that and we’re headed for trouble.”

It made me think about the many [Great Awakenings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Awakening) in the history of the US:

> Historians and theologians identify three, or sometimes four, waves of increased religious enthusiasm between the early 18th century and the late 20th century. Each of these "Great Awakenings" was characterized by widespread revivals led by evangelical Protestant ministers, a sharp increase of interest in religion, a profound sense of conviction and redemption on the part of those affected, an increase in evangelical church membership, and the formation of new religious movements and denominations.

This isn't new, it keeps happening here! Why? Is absolute control of the individual moral individual the answer to our problems? Has it "worked" in the past?

I also believe we need a revolution to get out of the shit we're in, but I think it matters what "religion" we're reviving. I'd prefer we revive a care for nature and the quality of life for those with the least. It seems like what Chris Church offers is another person in power using the banner of the Bible to maintain and grow their power.

Finally, I also run across an [investigation by Vice](https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ezwx/inside-the-church-that-preaches-wives-need-to-be-led-with-a-firm-hand) that I haven't read through. It addresses some of the abuse within the church as claimed by members. It also has a [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_Church_(Moscow,_Idaho)) that might have some more information. I had a [Daily Kos article](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2021/9/29/2055102/-Built-on-misogyny-and-racism-cult-like-church-attempts-spiritual-takeover-of-Idaho-college-town) open in my browser but didn't finish reading it.
