One of the longest ideas I had was for terracing. Terraced farms can happen at a variety of steepnesses, the steeper the terrain, the smaller the individual terraces will be.

I want this to be in a valley, and the Sacred Valley of the Inca is a strong inspiration. Because it's a valley, there are some parts that are lower and more hilly and then there are higher and more steep cliffs.

The Sacred Valley of the Incas is in the Peruvian Andes which were created by the Nazca oceanic plate submerging below the Andes continental plate. This puts the mountains right next to the ocean and means there's a lot of earthquakes and volcanos.

I also like the architecture of the Ancestral Puebloans, but I wonder if building homes into steep canyon walls is compatible with my other ideas. Cliff Palace of Mesa Verde was built under erosion-resistant sandstone. It sits in a cliff alcove in the dissected tableland (cuesta) of the area.

The Kashmir Valley is an ancient lake bed surrounded by the Himalayas. Rainwater and snowmelt from the surrounding mountains drain through the basin. Temperature inversions often occur when cold (dense) air becomes trapped under warmer air, resulting in haze settling into the valley, [as pictured](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/84862/haze-in-the-kashmir-valley).

This is similar to the [tule fog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tule_fog) of the Central Valley of California during winter seasons. Fog is pulled via the San Francisco bay and settles into the valley where it is trapped.

[Fog in the Bitterroot Mountains](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/88334/fog-in-the-bitterroot-mountains) in the Idaho Panhandle. This fog is formed via radiation where air is cooled over night below its dew point, favoring conditions where there's a shallow surface layer of moist air beneath a dry layer of clear skies and light surface winds.

## Brain dump

Maybe there can be a rainforest forest below the valley that causes a lot of evaporation that, when pushed up the mountain, produces fog.

Maybe there's a steep part that drops all the rain, it causes a big rainforest, behind it is a rain shadow, somehow the forest produces a lot of evaporation that is pulled around(?) the steep part into the mountain valleys.
