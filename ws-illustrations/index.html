        <h1><a href="/">Nick Cassleman</a> - UChicago Web Services illustrations</h1>

        <p>I went to college at the University of Chicago and for a while I worked for their Web Services department. This was actually my first job programming computers! I wasn't very good yet, so they gave me a bunch of non-coding tasks to supplement my web work.</p>

        <p>After I left, they gave me a drawing tablet as a going-away present (so sweet!). Shortly after, they asked if I'd be interested in illustrating the hero images for their blog posts and I said oh yes pls. I never got paid for them. I was too big of a push over in those days to press the issue.</p>

        <p>Each illustration relates to the content of the article, so for each I'm providing a link to the article and a little description. I even added alt text in case you're using a screen reader. I only included my favorites here, but you can dig around the blog for more.</p>
