        <header>
            <p>I went to college at the University of Chicago, and for a while I worked for their Web Services department. This was actually my first job programming computers! I wasn't very good yet, so they gave me a bunch of non-coding tasks to supplement my web work including the occasional art project.</p>

            <p>After I left, they gave me a drawing tablet as a going-away present (so sweet!). Shortly after, they asked if I'd be interested in illustrating the hero images for the <a href="https://webservices.uchicago.edu/learningcenter/">Web Services blog</a> and I said oh yes pls. I never got paid for them.</p>

            <p>Each illustration relates to the content of the article, so for each I'm providing a link to the article and a little description. I only included my favorites here, but you can dig around the blog for more.</p>

Web Services fan a fancy "app challenge" to get folks to build phone apps. The winner that year was <cite data-medium="mobile-app">Open Macro</cite> which was about economic forecasting. The global weather map is based on real data!</p>

            <p><a href="https://webservices.uchicago.edu/learningcenter/article/content_strategy_an_overview/"><cite data-medium="blog-post">Content Strategy: An Overview</cite></a>. I don't quite remember the reasoning for this one. Content = substance = guts? Or maybe I was making a poop joke.</p>
