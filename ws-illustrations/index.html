<h1><a href="/">Nick Cassleman</a> - Illustrations for UChicago Web Services</h1>

<header>
  <p>My first web job was with Web Services at the University of Chicago. I ended up doing a bunch of other tasks for them, including the occasional art project. After I left, my friends from work they gave me a drawing tablet as a <a href="#tablet-thanks">going-away present</a>.</p>

  <p>I had already drawn a few illustrations for <a href="https://webservices.uchicago.edu/learningcenter/" title="UChicago Web Services blog">their blog</a>, and after I moved to Brooklyn, I continued drawing for them with my new tablet.</p>

  <p>Each illustration relates to the content of the article. For each, I've included a link to the article and a little description of my thought process.</p>

  <h1>Economic forecasting is about as predictable as the weather</h1>

  <img src="/ws-illustrations/app-challenge.png" alt="A forecaster stands in front of a weather map. The forecaster holds a phone as they describe Open Macro, the winner of the 2015 UChicago App Challenge which deals with economic forecasting." />

  <p><a href="https://webservices.uchicago.edu/learningcenter/article/uchicago_app_challenge_2015/"><cite data-medium="blog-post">2015 UChicago App Challenge</cite></a>. Web Services ran a fancy "app challenge" to get folks to build phone apps. The winner that year was <cite data-medium="mobile-app">Open Macro</cite> which was about economic forecasting. The global weather map in the illustration is based on data I got from DarkSky!</p>

  <h1>Presenting guts: Content of the human body</h1>

  <img src="/ws-illustrations/content-guts.png" alt="A teacher points to a poster depicting the human gut and the word 'content.' Beside the teacher is a table with an embalmbed brain and a model skeleton."  />

  <p><a href="https://webservices.uchicago.edu/learningcenter/article/content_strategy_an_overview/"><cite data-medium="blog-post">Content Strategy: An Overview</cite></a>. I don't quite remember the reasoning for this one. Content = substance = guts? Or maybe I was making a poop joke.</p>

  <h1>Researchers EXTRACTING DATA from WILLING SUBJECTS</h1>

  <img src="/ws-illustrations/data-workshop.png" alt="Researchers observe two subjects sitting in chairs, one working on a computer and the other on a phone. The subjects are hooked up to elaborate machines which produce fancy graphs revealing their inner thoughts." />

  <p><a href="https://webservices.uchicago.edu/learningcenter/article/how_we_can_help_researchers_with_data/"><cite data-medium="blog-post">How we can help researchers with data</cite></a>. The article talks about a workshop that helped researchers get data. You bet your dollar I captured those researchers collecting all kinds of data about their consumers.</p>

  <h1>Just talking to a therapist about my award-winning website</h1>

  <img src="/ws-illustrations/feedback.png" alt="A patient reclines in their therapist's office, nestled between a plant and a lamp. The patient explains that they'd like their webiste to win an award while the therapist takes notes." />

  <p><a href="https://webservices.uchicago.edu/learningcenter/article/work_with_your_clients_to_get_good_design_feedback/"><cite data-medium="blog-post">Work with your clients to get “good” design feedback</cite></a>. I think I saw the word client and thought about a person lounging on a psychoanalyst's chaise longue.</p>

  <h1>Mainstream browsers paint together at team-building event</h1>

  <img src="/ws-illustrations/html-email.png" alt="Four painters, each with the logo of a major browser on their back, surround their subject. They each paint their own interpreation of the giant email template being constructed in front of them." />

  <p><a href="https://webservices.uchicago.edu/learningcenter/article/what_to_expect_from_html_email/"><cite data-medium="blog-post">What to Expect from HTML Email</cite></a>. Okay I thought this one was clever. We have some of <abbr title="HTML Elves">HTMeLves</abbr> building a web page and then four different browsers trying to paint it. If you look close, they're each a little different. I came up with MailShrimp way before <cite data-medium="podcast-series">Serial</cite> did "Mailkimp."</p>

  <h1>Business Rat knows how to speak PowerPoint</h1>

  <img src="/ws-illustrations/maze.png" alt="A rat stands at a podium at AMAZE Conf: The Conference for Mazes. It uses a laser pointer to navigate the audience through their presentation about redesigning a maze." />

  <p><a href="https://webservices.uchicago.edu/learningcenter/article/refactoring_conditional_logic/"><cite data-medium="blog-post">Refactoring Conditional Logic</cite></a>. Complicated conditional logic is like a maze. Rats love mazes. This one is presenting at AMAZE Conf. <strong style="font-weight: unset; text-transform: uppercase">Get it?!</strong></p>

  <h1>"Entitled human; this is a safe space for robots <strong style="font-weight: unset; text-transform: uppercase;">exclusively</strong>"</h1>

  <img src="/ws-illustrations/robots.png" alt="A human dressed in an unconvincing robot costume is turned away from a club called Overclock'd. The bouncer and the others in line are all robots of various models." />

  <p style="border-left: 1px solid gray; padding-left: 1rem; font-style: italic; box-sizing: border-box;">If you're a lonely human looking for cold hard love, I have the place for you. New York's hottest club is <em style="font-style:normal;">Overclock'd</em>. This place has everything: exposed antennae, nostalgic dial-up sounds remixed, and enough WD-40 to make your wildest dreams come true.</quote>

  <p><a href="https://webservices.uchicago.edu/learningcenter/article/when_and_why_to_use_robots.txt_files/"><cite data-medium="blog-post">When and why to use robots.txt files</cite></a>. The article was about <code>robots.txt</code> so I got my brother Bren to sketch a few robot concepts that I incorporated into this illustration. Imagine how terrifying it would be to be a human spy in a robot club.</p>

  <h1>The Trojan horse was an ancient clown car filled with murderous warriors</h1>

  <img src="/ws-illustrations/security.png" alt="Three unassuming peasants pull a giant horse up to the entrance of a walled city. The guards look unphased by the gift, unaware of its sinister contents." />

  <p><a href="https://webservices.uchicago.edu/learningcenter/article/web_application_security_as_important_as_it_ever_was/"><cite data-medium="blog-post">Web Application Security: As Important as it Ever Was</cite></a>. This article is about web security, so I made a little illustration of the Trojan Horse being delivered. Don't open suspicious attachments! They might be filled with flesh-eating bugs!</p>

  <h1>Even Santa is a slave to marketing trends</h1>

  <img src="/ws-illustrations/seo-santa.png" alt="Santa sets in front of a high-tech machine used to determine if a website is naughty or nice using the Santa Engine Optimizer v2.0 guidelines." />

  <p><a href="https://webservices.uchicago.edu/learningcenter/article/seo_tactics_to_avoid/"><cite data-medium="blog-post">SEO: Tactics to Avoid</cite></a>. Normally SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization but here it's Santa Engine Optimzer. I think SEO has contributed to a decline in the web, so maybe this should feature Krampus instead. In my search engine, websites with lolcats would get higher rankings.</p>

  <h1>It's about the journey, not the destination</h1>

  <img src="/ws-illustrations/testing.png" alt="A Rube Goldberg: A person pulls a rope that releases the contents of a suspended water tank into the fish bowl below it. The bowl contains a model ship which is blown down a ramp by a fan when the bowl fills with water. The ship knocks over a series of dominoes that trigger a mouse trap which flings a marble into a basket. The weighted basic slides down another ramp and causes a pin to pop a helium balloon. The deflated balloon tips a scale causing a piece of cheese to be lowered in front of a mouse running on a wheel. The wheel spins as the mouse chases the cheese and cranks open a jack in the box. Jack springs out of the box and tips over a rock that falls onto a giant button. The button executes an automated test on a computer."/>

  <p><a href="https://webservices.uchicago.edu/learningcenter/article/a_n_introduction_to_automated_testing_with_behat/"><cite data-medium="blog-post">An Introduction to Automated Testing with Behat</cite></a>. This post was about testing, so I draw an elaborate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine">Rube Goldberg machine</a> that to executed a software test.</p>

  <p>My dear friend and coworker <a href="https://gabrielmcelwain.com/">Gabe McElwain</a> wrote this article! He designed a flag for a lunar colony that I've worn as a patch on my backpack since 2014. We used to share orange slices with each other at work.</p>

  <h1>God sees your inaccessible code :(</h1>

  <img src="/ws-illustrations/usability.png" alt="A developer feeds a website into a machine that measures its accessibility. The machine produces a long report that is then evaluated by a line of reviewers who discuss the results." />

  <p>I'm not sure we they ever published the article I draw this picture for. I can't find it anyway. It was about accessibility. I drew a special machine that eats websites and spits out long reports about their accessibility.</p>

  <p>As a thank you note for buying me the tablet, I drew this as the first illustration using my new drawing device.</p>
