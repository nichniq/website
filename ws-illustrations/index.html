            <p>I went to college at the University of Chicago, and for a while I worked for their Web Services department. This was actually my first job programming computers! I wasn't very good yet, so they gave me a bunch of non-coding tasks to supplement my web work including the occasional art project.</p>

            <p>After I left, they gave me a drawing tablet as a going-away present (so sweet!). Shortly after, they asked if I'd be interested in illustrating the hero images for the <a href="https://webservices.uchicago.edu/learningcenter/">Web Services blog</a> and I said oh yes pls. I never got paid for them.</p>

            <p>Each illustration relates to the content of the article, so for each I'm providing a link to the article and a little description. I only included my favorites here, but you can dig around the blog for more.</p>
