        <header>
            <p>I went to college at the University of Chicago, and for a while I worked for their Web Services department. This was actually my first job programming computers! I wasn't very good yet, so they gave me a bunch of non-coding tasks to supplement my web work including the occasional art project.</p>

            <p>After I left, they gave me a drawing tablet as a going-away present (so sweet!). Shortly after, they asked if I'd be interested in illustrating the hero images for the <a href="https://webservices.uchicago.edu/learningcenter/">Web Services blog</a> and I said oh yes pls. I never got paid for them.</p>

            <p>Each illustration relates to the content of the article, so for each I'm providing a link to the article and a little description. I only included my favorites here, but you can dig around the blog for more.</p>

Web Services fan a fancy "app challenge" to get folks to build phone apps. The winner that year was <cite data-medium="mobile-app">Open Macro</cite> which was about economic forecasting. The global weather map is based on real data!</p>

I don't quite remember the reasoning for this one. Content = substance = guts? Or maybe I was making a poop joke.</p>

            <p><a href=""><cite data-medium="blog-post">What to Expect from HTML Email</cite></a>. Okay I thought this one was clever. We have some of HTMeLves building a web page and then four different browsers trying to paint it. If you look close, they're each a little different. I came up with MailShrimp way before <cite data-medium="podcast-series">Serial</cite> did "Mailkimp."</p>

            <p style="border-left: 1px solid gray; padding-left: 1rem; font-style: italic; box-sizing: border-box;">If you're a lonely human looking for cold hard love, I have the place for you. New York's hottest club is <em style="font-style:normal;">Overclock'd</em>. This place has everything: exposed antennae, nostalgic dial-up sounds remixed, and enough WD-40 to make your wildest dreams come true.</quote>

The article was about <code>robots.txt</code> so I got my brother Bren to sketch a few robot concepts that I incorporated into this illustration. Imagine how terrifying it would be to be a human spy in a robot club.</p>

This article is about web security, so I made a little illustration of the Trojan Horse being delivered. It was ancient clown car filled with armed warriors. Obviously, the novel tactic was not part of Troy's threat model, as evidenced by the relaxed guards.</p>

Normally SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization but here it's Santa Engine Optimzer. I think SEO has contributed to a decline in the web, so maybe this should feature Krampus instead. In my search engine, websites with lolcats would get higher rankings.</p>

            <p>My dear friend and coworker <a href="http://gabrielmcelwain.com/">Gabe McElwain</a> wrote this article! He designed a moon colony flag that I've worn as a patch on my backpack since 2014. We used to share orange slices with each other at work.</p>

            <p>I'm not sure we they ever published the article I draw this picture for. I can't find it, anyway. It was about accessibility. I draw a special machine that eats websites and spits out long reports about their accessibility.</p>
