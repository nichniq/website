        <h2>Résumé</h2>

        <p>Here's my <a href="./resume.html">résumé</a>. If you want to get a hold of me, look at the mirror during a waxing crescent and whisper my name seven times.</p>

        <h2>A poem for you</h2>

        <code>
          <pre>CASCADE

When the universe
pours itself through you,
open your mouth wider
and let it overflow</pre>
        </code>

        <h2>Little drawings</h2>

        <p><img height="200" src="./robots.png" /></p>
        <p><img height="400" src="./figure.jpg" /></p>

        <h2>Work in progress</h2>

        <p>I wanted to throw this up because my employer is publishing something I wrote for their blog. "Nick do you have LinkedIn or social media?" Hell no! But yeah, I'll make the site look nicer and add more poems and illustrations and eventually writing and info about my game and stuff. <3</p>
