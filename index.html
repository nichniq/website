<!--
    The first tag in an HTML should be this <!doctype html> which yells out to
    the world: "WITNESS ME! I AM STANDARD HTML!" This is helpful for older
    browsers that handle outdated "quirks" in "quirks mode". We are telling
    those browsers that this file adheres to the standardized HTML specification

    This file encodes an HTML document that is represented as a "tree" which is

    The <html> element is the "root" element that contains all of the content.
    This page is written in English so I specify lang="en"
-->

<html lang="en">
    <!--
        The <head> element contains metadata: data about the data. It includes
        info that helps the browser know HOW to read and display my code
    -->

    <head>
        <!--
            The title is read by screen readers, the default name for a site's
            bookmark, and what a browser shows as the window/tab's name

        <title>Nick Cassleman</title>

        <!--
            This tells browsers to interpret my code with the full UTF-8 range
            of characters ("character set") instead of something more limited
            like ASCII, which would render weird stuff for ‚Ñ¢¬£¬¢‚àû¬ß&üëª
        -->

        <meta charset="utf-8" />

        <!--
            This tells browsers to set the page's width to the device's width.
            By default, many phones will render a page as though it is on a
            large screen, and then your phone becomes a little magnifying glass
            that you can move around (the "viewport"). I've built this website
            so that it's usable at variable widths
        -->

        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />

        <!--
            In the spirit of "no code is good code," I want there to be as few
            styles as possible. I define the universal ones in this sheet

            This allows browsers to cache the file for a slight performance gain
            (fewer bits are transferred across the wire per page load). It also
            lets me specify all the core styles in one place

            For pages with page-specific styles (or markup with inline
            adjustments) I use <style> tags and the `style` attribute.

            In the future, I mind find a way to serve all styles inline so that
            each HTML page contains all the content it needs without a bunch of
            linking

            name and a little bit about myself. I consider it intro text instead
            of main content, because the important stuff is what I've done, not
            my own self description
