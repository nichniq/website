        <h1><a href="/">Nick Cassleman</a> - College artifacts</h1>

        <header>
            <p>I was a high schooler that knew what he wanted. Discounting the mom-mandaded <abbr title="University of Washington">UW</abbr> and <abbr title="Washington State University">WSU</abbr>, I only applied to the University of Chicago. It sounded like nerd heaven; it was in a city far from home; and my friend Kat was going. It ended up being a bad fit. My classes demanded too much work of me, too much reading, too much theory. I learned to avoid school work that bored me and instead focused my attention on the fun stuff.</p>

            <p>I switched majors from neuroscience to chemistry to computer science before landing on my a self-designed curriculum as part of the Interdiscplinary Studies in the Humanities department. To study "Interactive Media and Game Design," I combined classes from creative writing, psychology, computer science, visual arts, and critical game theory. My senior thesis was a game about exploring affect theory through gameplay.</p>

            <p>I also did hella clubs. I was a leader in clubs for aikido, Scav Hunt, circus, game design, queer life, dorm council, Dean's Advisory Council. Yes, this is me bragging. It's my website and they gave me a fancy award for it when I graduated.</p>

            <p>From those times, I kept my a few artifacts I liked and threw away the rest.</p>

            <p>I made informational posters for a few clubs. They were fine.</p>
