        <h1><a href="/">Nick Cassleman</a> - College artifacts</h1>

        <header>
            <p>I was a high schooler that knew what he wanted. Discounting the mom-mandaded <abbr title="University of Washington">UW</abbr> and <abbr title="Washington State University">WSU</abbr>, I only applied to the University of Chicago. It sounded like nerd heaven; it was in a city far from home; and my friend Kat was going. It ended up being a bad fit. My classes demanded too much work of me, too much reading, too much theory. I learned to avoid school work that bored me and instead focused my attention on the fun stuff.</p>

            <p>I switched majors from neuroscience to chemistry to computer science before landing on my a self-designed curriculum as part of the Interdiscplinary Studies in the Humanities department. To study "Interactive Media and Game Design," I combined classes from creative writing, psychology, computer science, visual arts, and critical game theory. My senior thesis was a game about exploring affect theory through gameplay.</p>

            <p>I also did hella clubs. I was a leader in clubs for aikido, Scav Hunt, circus, game design, queer life, dorm council, Dean's Advisory Council. Yes, this is me bragging. It's my website and they gave me a fancy award for it when I graduated.</p>

            <p>From those times, I kept my a few artifacts I liked and threw away the rest.</p>

            <p>I made informational posters for a few clubs. They were fine.</p>

            <h1>Oils</h1>

            <img src="/college-artifacts/rust.jpg" alt="" />
            <img src="/college-artifacts/gray-stair.jpg" alt="" />
            <img src="/college-artifacts/color-wheel.jpg" alt="" />

            <p>I took a painting class and learned a bit about painting in oils. I didn't really know how to draw or make art outside my personal cartoon styles, so I relied heavily on abstract. (This has been a common theme in my life, see <a href="/drink-n-draw.html#styled">the stylized figures from Drink n' Draw</a>.)</p>


            <ol>
                <li>I guess this one was supposed to be dirty and sinister and layered. During critiques, I set my painting up on a plinth with my dirty rags behind a temporary well used for everyone else's paintings. I made everyone wedge themselves into the tight, dark space to look at it. It was a cheap trick.</li>
                <li>This one was an abstraction of a staircase outside the art room. I was playing with chromatic grays (grays that have bits of color in them).</li>
                <li>For our final, I made this weird sculpture where I painted the inside of a light fixture and you were supposed to play with reflections of the color wheel as you walked around it. The light fixture was placed on a color wheel on a mirror on a trash can in the middle of an atrium with a cool vantage point to look at it.</li>
