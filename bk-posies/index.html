        <header>
            <p>I lived in Crown Heights for about three years. Around the corner from me was a darling little shop, <a href="https://www.parkdelibk.com/">Park Deli</a>: <span class="park-deli">Skateboards, flowers, dry-goods</span>. I wanted to learn the names of flowers, so I'd stop in every week and make myself a bouquet, asking Mike or Valentine for the names of ones I didn't know.</p>

            <p>I didn't want to keep the arrangements hidden away in my house, so I'd bring them to my regular cafe Breukelen. I became friends with Cara, one of the baristas / uncompensated managers, and she took the good-looking pictures below (the ones with a crappy phone camera are mine). When I had Instagram, I'd post pictures of the ones I liked. I still liking arranging flowers, but I don't take pictures of them anymore. The nature of flowers is fleeting!</p>
