  <h2>College oils</h2>

  <p>I took a painting class in college and learned a bit about painting in oils. I didn't really know how to draw or make art outside my personal cartoon styles, so I relied heavily on abstract. (This has been a common theme in my life, see <a href="/drink-n-draw/#styled">the stylized figures from Drink n' Draw</a>.)</p>

  <figcaption>
    <p>I guess this one was supposed to be dirty and sinister and layered. During critiques, I set my painting up on a plinth with my dirty rags behind a temporary well used for everyone else's paintings. I made everyone wedge themselves into the tight, dark space to look at it. It was a cheap trick.</p>

  <figcaption>
    <p>This one was an abstraction of a staircase outside the art room. I was playing with chromatic grays (grays that have bits of color in them).</p>

  <h2>College watercolor</h2>

  <p>Watercolors freak me out because I love to overwork things and that's a big no-no with watercolor. Still, a friend asked if I could illustrate a pair of articles for the <cite data-medium="magazine">Southside Weekly</cite> magazine after seeing a poster I'd made for taco night watercolor I made for Z&H Market Cafe.</p>

    <p>An illustration for <a href="https://southsideweekly.com/fish-sauce/"><cite data-medium="poem">Fish Sauce</cite></a>. I draw a little scene depicting a fish-based divination which doesn't have anything to do with the poem but I thought looked cool.</p>

  <figcaption>
    <p>An illustration for <a href="https://southsideweekly.com/spokane/"><cite data-medium="poem">Spokane</cite></a>, by my friend Hannah. She had an aunt and uncle there who owned a goat farm in Spokane near where I grew up in WA. The pose is inspired by Joanna Newsom's <cite data-medium="album">Ys</cite>; the hills in the background are of the Palouse, the land around Spokane; and I guess I thought a penknife was a pen that actually had a knife under the cap.</p>

  <figcaption>
    <p>My regular sandwich shop, Z&H Market Cafe, had a weekly taco night for a while. One time, I bought a bunch of supplies for fresh margaritas and made the staff and my friends drinks for the night. I painted this for Margarita Night.</p>
