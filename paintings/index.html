  <h2>College oils</h2>

  <p>I took a painting class in college and learned a bit about oils. This was my formal art instruction since maybe elementary school, so I relied heavily on abstract to cover up for my lack of technical ability.</p>

  <figcaption>
    <p>I guess this one was supposed to be dirty and sinister and layered? During critiques, I set the painting up on a plinth alongside my dirty yellow rags. To look at it, I made folks wedge into the tight space behind the temporary wall holding up everyone else's art. A cheap trick.</p>

    <p>This os an abstraction of a staircase outside the art room. I had just learned about chromatic grays, which I am still in love with. (Chromatic gray is a with bits of color in them.)</p>

  <h2>College watercolor</h2>

  <p>Watercolors freak me out because I love to overwork things (and that's a big no-no with watercolor). Still, a friend asked if I could illustrate a pair of articles for the <cite data-medium="magazine">Southside Weekly</cite> magazine after seeing a watercolor poster I'd made at my favorite cafÃ©.</p>

    <p>An illustration for <a href="https://southsideweekly.com/fish-sauce/"><cite data-medium="poem">Fish Sauce</cite></a>. I draw a little scene depicting a fish-based divination which doesn't have anything to do with the poem but I thought looked cool.</p>

  <figcaption>
    <p>An illustration for <a href="https://southsideweekly.com/spokane/"><cite data-medium="poem">Spokane</cite></a>, by my friend Hannah. She had an aunt and uncle there who owned a goat farm in Spokane near where I grew up in WA. The pose is inspired by Joanna Newsom's album, <cite data-medium="album">Ys</cite>. The hills in the background are of the Palouse, the land around Spokane.</p>

  <figcaption>
    <p>My regular sandwich shop, Z&H Market Cafe, used to have a weekly taco night. I'd usually made drinks for my friends (aka the staff). One time, painted a picture to go along with the margaritas.</p>
