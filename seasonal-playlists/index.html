<h1><a href="/">Nick Cassleman</a> - Seasonal playlists</h1>

<header>
  <p>
    I started using Spotify in 2015. They have a feature called Discover Weekly that gives you a playlist every week with songs they think you'll like. I started saving my favorites and found that each season collected about 20 songs. I broke them up into seasonal playlists and have been keeping it up since I started.

  <!-- temporarily not true -->
  <!--p>
    For each playlist, I've provided its track list and link to Spotify. If JavaScript is enabled, you can use the button to load the playlist widget served by Spotify. Doing so requires DRM and agreeing to the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/widgets/terms/">Spotify Widget Terms of Use</a>.
