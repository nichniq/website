        <header>
            <p>After college, I moved to New York to "find my fortune." During my time living in Brooklyn, I spent a couple of years attending a weekly figure drawing session called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/drink_n_draw/">Drink n' Draw</a>. It happened every Wednesday at the Bat Haus off the Jefferson stop on the L train. $20 got you 2.5 hours with a live model and unlimited cans of beer from our sponsor, Brooklyn Brewery. What a steal!</p>

            <p>I've never been taught how to draw. I took an art class in college with the performance artist <a href="https://www.popel.nyc/">Pope.L</a>, but the day we were learning about Line, we had to partner up with someone and do an interpretive performance instead of, you know, learning how to draw a line.</p>

            <p>My drawings have improved over the years with inconsistent practice, but I still don't really know what I'm doing. I got some advice "just draw what you see," so I think my goal is to learn how to better "see like an artist" and then develop some technique.</p>

            <h1>Context & relief</h1>

            <img src="./drink-n-draw/40.jpg" />

            <p>I was pretty shy during this part of my life, so I didn't make any friends there for about a year. Instead, I would sit quietly by myself and sketch the curtain while we waited for the session to start. I'd pick a spot in the back near the middle next to a handsome man with a beard and a name I've forgotten. I crushed over this straight man for months before attempting to strike up conversations that went no where. Eventually, I did make friends with two other regulars who are legit good at art: <a href="//www.anna-rosenfeld.com">Anna Rosenfeld</a> and <a href="https://www.sarasarmiento.com/">Sara Sarmiento</a>.</p>

            <h1>Line & gesture</h1>

            <img src="./drink-n-draw/06.jpg" />
            <img src="./drink-n-draw/08.jpg" />
            <img src="./drink-n-draw/17.jpg" />
            <img src="./drink-n-draw/35.jpg" />
            <img src="./drink-n-draw/37.jpg" />

            <p>Sessions began with 15 second gesture drawings. These came out better when I was confident with my lines and drew from the heart. I would describe these as "zazzy."</p>

            <h1>Shape & figure</h1>

            <img src="./drink-n-draw/22.jpg" />
            <img src="./drink-n-draw/19.jpg" />
            <img src="./drink-n-draw/26.jpg" />
            <img src="./drink-n-draw/20.jpg" />
            <img src="./drink-n-draw/33.jpg" />

            <p>After the gestures, we'd move onto a series of shorter poses. Again, when I didn't focus on details and drew with confidence, I liked my work better. I'd focus on proportions and do simple shading if at all. Things always went downhill when I attempted faces, hands, and feet. Boobs were always an easy place to start.</p>
