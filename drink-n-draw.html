        <header>
            <p>After college, I moved to New York to "find my fortune." During my time living in Brooklyn, I spent a couple of years attending a weekly figure drawing session called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/drink_n_draw/">Drink n' Draw</a>. It happened every Wednesday at the Bat Haus off the Jefferson stop on the L train. $20 got you 2.5 hours with a live model and unlimited cans of beer from our sponsor, Brooklyn Brewery. What a steal!</p>

            <p>I've never been taught how to draw. I took an art class in college with the performance artist <a href="https://www.popel.nyc/">Pope.L</a>, but the day we were learning about Line, we had to partner up with someone and do an interpretive performance instead of, you know, learning how to draw a line.</p>

            <p>My drawings have improved over the years with inconsistent practice, but I still don't really know what I'm doing. I got some advice "just draw what you see," so I think my goal is to learn how to better "see like an artist" and then develop some technique.</p>
