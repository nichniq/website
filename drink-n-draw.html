        <header>
            <p>After college, I moved to New York to "find my fortune." During my time living in Brooklyn, I spent a couple of years attending a weekly figure drawing session called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/drink_n_draw/">Drink n' Draw</a>. It happened every Wednesday at the Bat Haus off the Jefferson stop on the L train. $20 got you 2.5 hours with a live model and unlimited cans of beer from our sponsor, Brooklyn Brewery. What a steal!</p>

            <p>I've never been taught how to draw. I took an art class in college with the performance artist <a href="https://www.popel.nyc/">Pope.L</a>, but the day we were learning about Line, we had to partner up with someone and do an interpretive performance instead of, you know, learning how to draw a line.</p>

            <p>My drawings have improved over the years with inconsistent practice, but I still don't really know what I'm doing. I got some advice "just draw what you see," so I think my goal is to learn how to better "see like an artist" and then develop some technique.</p>

            <h1>Context & relief</h1>

            <img src="/drink-n-draw/16.jpg" alt="Curtain from April 20, 2016. It's drawn with blocks of shadow and highlight." />

            <img src="/drink-n-draw/31.jpg" alt="Curtain from July 1, 2016. It's draw with simple lines." />

            <img src="/drink-n-draw/40.jpg" alt="Curtain from March 9, 2016. It's drawn with smooth shadows." />

            <p>I was pretty shy during this part of my life, so I didn't make any friends there for about a year. Instead, I would sit quietly by myself and sketch the curtain while we waited for the session to start. I'd pick a spot in the back near the middle next to a handsome man with a beard and a name I've forgotten. I crushed over this straight man for months before attempting to strike up conversations that went no where. Eventually, I did make friends with two other regulars who are legit good at art: <a href="//www.anna-rosenfeld.com">Anna Rosenfeld</a> and <a href="https://www.sarasarmiento.com/">Sara Sarmiento</a>.</p>

            <h1>Line & gesture</h1>

            <img src="/drink-n-draw/06.jpg" alt="A person is hunched over with long hair. They look like a sea creature. Drawn with gestural lines." />

            <img src="/drink-n-draw/08.jpg" alt="Half of someone's body and their boob; their hip is popped. Drawn with gestural lines." />

            <img src="/drink-n-draw/17.jpg" alt="A person's hand propped up on their lower back. Drawn with a gestural lines." />

            <img src="/drink-n-draw/35.jpg" alt="A person standing on one leg. 'I'm a flamingo!' their body says. Drawn with gestural lines." />

            <img src="/drink-n-draw/37.jpg" alt="Someone with their arms up in the air. Maybe they were leveling an imaginary painting on the wall. Drawin with gestural lines." />

            <p>Sessions began with 15 second gesture drawings. These came out better when I was confident with my lines and drew from the heart. I would describe these as "zazzy."</p>

            <h1>Shape & figure</h1>

            <img src="/drink-n-draw/22.jpg" alt="A man's full body, posed like Michaelangelo's David. Drawn with clean lines." />

            <img src="/drink-n-draw/19.jpg" alt="A woman leaning back in a chair. Drawn with clean lines and a white pencil for highlights." />

            <img src="/drink-n-draw/26.jpg" alt="A woman's mid section, standing. No arms, no head, just the tops of the legs. Shadows and highlights drawn in blocks." />

            <img src="/drink-n-draw/20.jpg" alt="A woman's torso, leaning backward. Drawn with large blocks of shadow and highlight." />

            <img src="/drink-n-draw/33.jpg" alt="A man's mid section, hands on hips. Drawn with simple lines and stylized." />

            <p>After the gestures, we'd move onto a series of shorter poses. Again, when I didn't focus on details and drew with confidence, I liked my work better. I'd focus on proportions and do simple shading if at all. Things always went downhill when I attempted faces, hands, and feet. Boobs were always an easy place to start.</p>

            <h1>Form & depth</h1>

            <img src="/drink-n-draw/11.jpg" alt="A woman with her arm squishing her boobies. There's a gleaming highligh on her shoulder. Drawn with smoothed shadows." />

            <img src="/drink-n-draw/05.jpg" alt="The sliver of a woman's front side. Drawn with several values but without a lot of smoothing." />

            <img src="/drink-n-draw/04.jpg" alt="A circumcised penis! Well-trimmed public hair! Drawn with smoothed shadows." />

            <img src="/drink-n-draw/10.jpg" alt="A woman half hidden by the edge of the page. She has a lovely collarbone. Drawn with smoothed shadows." />

            <img src="/drink-n-draw/27.jpg" alt="A woman and the wonderful folds of her skin. Her face is blank. Drawn with smoothed shadows." />

            <p>The sessions ended with longer poses and this is when I'd practice shading. I never felt like I got the hang of this because I wasn't really following a process; I just drew what I saw instead of trying to understand why I saw it. I'd be several beers in which I'm not sure hurt or helped. By this point, the line for the bathroom was tremendous, so I'd often skip one of the poses to avoid the discomfort of my drawing ineptitude by waiting in line.</p>

            <h1 id="styled">Style & interpretation</h1>

            <img src="/drink-n-draw/14.jpg" alt="A cartoonishly skinny woman, sitting in a chair turned away from the viewer. Her body is drawn with smoothed shadows while her hair and chair with parallel lines." />

            <img src="/drink-n-draw/07.jpg" alt="An old man sitting in a chair holding his funny little hat. He's got bug eyes and a flipper for a foot. The shadows in the drawing are scribbles." />

            <img src="/drink-n-draw/34.jpg" alt="A person looking over their shoulder. Their outline is drawn with loopy lines and the smooth shadows drawn between the lines serve as artificial gradients rather than shadow." />

            <img src="/drink-n-draw/42.jpg" alt="A big bearded boy sitting with his arms crossed. He has a chode and ghostly eyes. The shadows are mostly realistic but his arms kind of fuse together." />

            <img src="/drink-n-draw/49.jpg" alt="Two models, a woman sitting in a chair with a man standing beside her. They are drawn as cats: the woman has six tits and the cowl of a nun, the man has three tails and a fencing foil." />

            <p>I liked these stylized drawings the most because I could cover up my lack of technical expertise with my creative spirit. "It's supposed to look like that!" The guy that ran the event would walk around and take pictures of people's work to put up on the Instagram. It was everyone's secret wish to have their drawings photographed and I was proud the few times he used mine. I'm sure they fell into this category.</p>
