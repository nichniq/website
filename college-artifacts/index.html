        <h1><a href="/">Nick Cassleman</a> - College artifacts</h1>

        <header>
            <p>I went to college at the University of Chicago, but it ended up being a bad fit. My classes demanded too much work of me, too much reading, too much theory. I learned to avoid school work that bored me and instead focused my attention on the fun stuff.</p>

            <p>I switched directions a bunch before designing my own curriculum as part of the Interdiscplinary Studies in the Humanities department. To study "Interactive Media and Game Design," I combined classes from creative writing, psychology, computer science, visual arts, and critical game theory. My senior thesis was a game about exploring affect theory through gameplay.</p>

            <p>I also did hella clubs. I was a leader in clubs for aikido, Scav Hunt, circus, game design, queer life, dorm council, Dean's Advisory Council. They gave me a fancy award for it when I graduated. Yes, this is me bragging.</p>

            <p>From those times, I kept a few of the files I liked and threw away the rest.</p>

            <p>I made informational posters for a few clubs. They were fine.</p>

            <img src="/college-artifacts/gray-stair.jpg" alt="" />

            <p>I took a painting class and learned a bit about painting in oils. I didn't really know how to draw or make art outside my personal cartoon styles, so I relied heavily on abstract. (This has been a common theme in my life, see <a href="/drink-n-draw/#styled">the stylized figures from Drink n' Draw</a>.)</p>


            <ol>
                <li>I guess this one was supposed to be dirty and sinister and layered. During critiques, I set my painting up on a plinth with my dirty rags behind a temporary well used for everyone else's paintings. I made everyone wedge themselves into the tight, dark space to look at it. It was a cheap trick.</li>
                <li>This one was an abstraction of a staircase outside the art room. I was playing with chromatic grays (grays that have bits of color in them).</li>

            <h1>Watercolors</h1>

            <img src="/college-artifacts/goat-portrait.png" alt="" />
            <img src="/college-artifacts/margarita-night.jpg" alt="" />

            <p>Watercolors freak me out because I love to overwork things and that's a big no-no with watercolor. Still, a friend asked if I could illustrate a pair of articles for the <cite data-medium="magazine">Southside Weekly</cite> magazine after seeing a poster I'd made for taco night watercolor I made for Z&H Market Cafe.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>An illustration for <a href="https://southsideweekly.com/fish-sauce/"><cite data-medium="poem">Fish Sauce</cite></a>. I draw a little scene depicting a fish-based divination which doesn't have anything to do with the poem but I thought looked cool.</li>
                <li>An illustration for <a href="https://southsideweekly.com/spokane/"><cite data-medium="poem">Spokane</cite></a>, by my friend Hannah. She had an aunt and uncle there who owned a goat farm in Spokane near where I grew up in WA. The pose is inspired by Joanna Newsom's <cite data-medium="album">Ys</cite>; the hills in the background are of the Palouse, the land around Spokane; and I guess I thought a penknife was a pen that actually had a knife under the cap.</li>
                <li>My regular sandwich shop, Z&H Market Cafe, had a weekly taco night for a while. One time, I bought a bunch of supplies for fresh margaritas and made the staff and my friends drinks for the night. I painted this for Margarita Night.</li>

            <p>I dabbled in music composition software during high school. During that time, I was mediocre at playing the viola and had taught myself a bit of music theory, guitar, and piano. In college, I took a music composition course and wrote this for an assignment. My friend Thomas performed it, and I think he did a great job. Unfortunately, I don't think my teacher thought I had done as great of a job with the piece. I forgot what I named it, and I've lost the sheet music.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>My butt print. For Scav Hunt, we had an item where teams had to guess which judge's butt print was whose. ðŸ˜ˆ</li>
                <li>I ran for house council with my friend and future roommate Julia. Together, we were Noggs.</li>
                <li>We had a tradition of making ridiculous campaigns and for this one, I did an MS paint aesthetic.</li>
                <li>I tried <abbr title="National Novel Writing Month">NaNoWriMo</abbr> a few times. One year, I made this book cover for the novel I was writing. It was about a city with a vaccine for sleep that is kept under constant illumination. The Onieronauts Wresting for Evolutionary Liberation (O.W.E.L.) was my heavy-handed name for the rebels trying to dream again and rediscover night.</li>
                <li>My proposal for a Scav Hunt judge t-shirt. It's a two-dimensional shadow of a three-dimensional shadow of a four-dimensional tesseract.</li>
