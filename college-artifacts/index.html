        <h1><a href="/">Nick Cassleman</a> - College artifacts</h1>

        <header>
            <p>I went to college at the University of Chicago, but it ended up being a bad fit. My classes demanded too much work of me, too much reading, too much theory. I learned to avoid school work that bored me and instead focused my attention on the fun stuff.</p>

            <p>I switched directions a bunch before designing my own curriculum as part of the Interdiscplinary Studies in the Humanities department. To study "Interactive Media and Game Design," I combined classes from creative writing, psychology, computer science, visual arts, and critical game theory. My senior thesis was a game about exploring affect theory through gameplay.</p>

            <p>I also did hella clubs. I was a leader in clubs for aikido, Scav Hunt, circus, game design, queer life, dorm council, Dean's Advisory Council. They gave me a fancy award for it when I graduated. Yes, this is me bragging.</p>

            <p>From those times, I kept a few of the files I liked and threw away the rest.</p>

                <li>I ran for house council with my friend and future roommate Julia. Together, we were Noggs.</li>
                <li>We had a tradition of making ridiculous campaigns and for this one, I did an MS paint aesthetic.</li>
                <li>I tried <abbr title="National Novel Writing Month">NaNoWriMo</abbr> a few times. One year, I made this book cover for the novel I was writing. It was about a city with a vaccine for sleep that is kept under constant illumination. The Onieronauts Wresting for Evolutionary Liberation (O.W.E.L.) was my heavy-handed name for the rebels trying to dream again and rediscover night.</li>
                <li>My proposal for a Scav Hunt judge t-shirt. It's a two-dimensional shadow of a three-dimensional shadow of a four-dimensional tesseract.</li>
