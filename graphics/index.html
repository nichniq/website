    <p>I tried <abbr title="National Novel Writing Month">NaNoWriMo</abbr> a few times. One year, I made this book cover for the novel I was writing. It was about a city with a vaccine for sleep that is kept under constant illumination. The Onieronauts Wresting for Evolutionary Liberation (O.W.E.L.) was my heavy-handed name for the rebels trying to dream again and rediscover night.</p>
