A lot of stuff is just text. That's defined in blocks like this. Blocks are
separated by empty lines.

- Lists are common
- Lists also get a simple notation
- For anything more complex, we need blocks

{{ text
    Block notation allows you to define what kind of block you're creating. The
    block type describes how its content is parsed. This is just a text block,
    like the one above, but explicitly names itself. Content is indented.
}}

{{ list | ordered
    - Blocks may also receive attributes
    - Attributes describe more about the block type
    - They are a space separated list of adjectives
}}

We can define local shorthands for common operations in the file. They are
local so that we don't have to go hunting for definitions. You can decide what's
most clear in your file without making choices for someone else's.

{{ shorthands
    list      -> :
    comment   -> !
    bold      -> *
    underline -> _
    italic    -> /
    heading   -> #
    link      -> @
}}

{{ # Shorthand use }}

{{ :
    - As block type, like this list block
    - As a single-line block definition, like the heading
    - As inline-block notation, such as for {* bolding}
    - With attributes, like for {@ links | www.example.com}
}}
