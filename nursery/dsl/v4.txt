{{{ DSL, fourth iteration

This version of the DSL is simpler.

- Everything is wrapped in a block
  - Blocks start with "{{{" and end with "}}}"
  - Blocks are titled by the text that follows their opening
- Spacing is flexible
  - One or more lines between content separates them
  - Spacing is trimmed within a block
- Manual block types aren't needed / supported yet
  - Text looks like normal
  - Lists use "-" and support hierarchies
  - Mappings use "->" for now
    - The only mappings currently in use are links
- Attributes or metadata aren't supported either
