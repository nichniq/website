Long

- Type: The kind of DNS record
  - A: This is a stable IP address, super direct
  - ALIAS: Points to another name, used for apex (can't also have A)
  - CNAME: Points to another name
  - MX: Records for email exchange
  - TXT: Arbitrary text, like these comments or lightweight verification
- Name: The domain or subcomain
  - @: This refers to the root, i.e. nichniq.name
  - $name: This refers to a subdomain, e.g. name.nichniq.name
- TTL: How long the resolution should be cached by the requester
  - DNS resolutions take time, especially if there's redirection
  - Each request needs to be processed, so we avoid them if possible
  - We can cache responses based on their of Time to Live (TTL)
  - Set long TTLs for stable records you don't expect to change
  - Load balancers need short TTLs to stay up-to-date
  - I shorten TTLs while developing (if I don't expect traffic)
