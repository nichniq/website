/**
  * Monospace font gives a strong aesthetic anchor to this website. It's the
  * first rule in the stylesheet! It says: "this website was built on a
  * computer." Hopefully, that hints at the underlying beauty of the code,
  * itself rendered in monospace font.
  *
  * I mostly test in my browser of choice: up-to-date Mozilla Firefox. I limit
  * the control I try to exert over the browser. I'm letting it do the heavy
  * lifting and adding a bit of makeup here and there.
  *
  * Monospace also reminds me of videogame walkthroughs on GameFAQs (the
  * inspiration for my upcoming website: GameFAGs). They were so well structured
  * and thorough, simple and easy-to-use.
