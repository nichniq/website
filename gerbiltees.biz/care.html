                    <p><em>"Its true what they say. Gerbils are not for the Faint of
Heart. Gerbils may be Beautiful, but they're delicate and fussy. Gerbils
 are pernicious. Gerbils are Capricious, and they only drink the real
kind of Champaigne. Some would say their high-maintenance, others would
say that their the Ride of your Life. To have a gerbil is to know
transendance. To take indulgence by the Horns and Ride it into a
sunset-glazed Spanish villa and make sweet love to it on the floor next
to an infinity pool shaped like a Gerbil. To put it succintly: gerbils
require alot of care, but there going to care you right back!!!"</em><br><em style="padding-left:20px">-Dana and Rich Heldman</em></p>

                <td>
                    <p>The Most important thing to know when caring For Your Gerbil is
that Gerbils they are WILD ANIMALS. DO NOT UNDER ANY circumstances place
 your finger in the mouth of the gerbil playfully for it may bite the
finger causing bleeding. The Gerbils mouth is for food and if the Gerbil
 approaches you for friendly petting IT seeks the attention you can
provide, But you should not provoke it.</p>

                    <p>Gerbils they eat lots of leafed greens such as lettuces kales
cabbages and other Greens. Make sure to wash these Gerbil greens because
 pesticides can Harm your Gerbil. Occasionally the Gerbil may seek a
crunchy vegetable such as a Carrot. It is OK to give the Gerbil crunchy
foods such as a Carrot because it does enjoy the crunch of it. Also make
 sure your Gerbil has lots of Fresh Water preferably in a bottle that is
 cleaned often and is always refilled. If you do go on vacation do NOT
leave your Gerbil with lots of food because the Gerbil it cannot ration,
 have a friend come to feed Your Gerbil and also to water. Also the
Gerbil might like a seed snack and you can buy it a seed snack at a
Petstore such as Petco or Pet Smart in the Aisle "For Gerbils". </p>

                    <p>For Sleeping the Gerbil prefers a soft bedding such as a Cotton
or a Sawdust or a Shredded Paper bedding. It may make a nest, this is ok
 because the Gerbil in nature will burrow and nest. </p>

                    <p>For Playtime the Gerbil likes tubes and huts and also a wheel.
Make sure the Gerbil has soft woods where it may nibble or gnash to
ensure the maintenance and not overgrowing of the teeth. If you get your
 Gerbil a companion it may like this, make sure that it is a same gender
 Companion to AVOID REPRODUCING of Gerbils. </p>

                    <p>Clean the cage REGULARLY for hygiene and maintenance of
scents/odor. If you do not clean the cage THOROUGHLY removing the wastes
 and replacing the Bedding and cleaning the bottle it may grow a mold
and become foul which can spread diseases to harm you children Gerbil or
 adjacent pets.</p>

clean them less than inferior pets like hampsters and nasty rats. Clean
your gerbil's cage once a week with disfectant. If you keep your pets in
 a Gerbilarium, clean it every two or three weeks. If they use one area
of there home as a potty, clean it more.</dd>
