                    <ul style="width:75%; margin:0 auto;">
                        <li>Gerbils will thump the ground with their back feet and if you
have more than one gerbil in a cage, they will all join in thumping
together! Gerbils will thump when they are excited, happy, stressed or
even bored and young gerbils will thump for no reason at all!</li>
                        <li>The general life span of a gerbil is between 2-3 years but both of my gerbils lived for 4 years!</li>
                        <li>Gerbils were first brought to the United States in 1949. They
are small dessert-dwelling animals originally found in Europe, Asia, and
 Africa!</li>
                        <li>Fun fact: If your gerbil runs away, it is because you have done something bad. It will return to you when you are pure of heart.</li>
                        <li>Unlike other rodents the dad gerbil will help raise the pups
after the mother gives birth, so there is no need to separate the pair
when the babies are born.</li>
                        <li>Gerbils love to gnaw and their teeth keep growing throughout their entire lives!!</li>
                        <li>Fun fact: Between 20-50 percent of gerbils have epilepsy.</li>
                        <li>Gerbils can hop and jump and will race each other around their
 cage. They are very fast jumpers and if they get loose, you will have a
 hard time catching them!</li>
                        <li>A gerbils entire body is covered in fur, even its tail!</li>
                        <li>Gerbils are very inquisitive and will check out anything new!</li>
                        <li>In the wild, gerbils will roll themselves in the sand to make their fur shinier and smoother!</li>
                        <li>A gerbil's tail is long and detachable!!</li>
                        <li>DID YOU KNOW that the gerbil's scientific name, Gerbillus gerbillus, means gerbil?</li>
                        <li>Fun fact: Gerbils are perfectly capable of chewing through
those metal mesh covers on the tops of their cages, but they choose not
to escape because they love you.</li>
