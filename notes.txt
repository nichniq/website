- keep all receipts
- must be simple + easy
- not meant to be a perfect record
- interesting record of your life and habits
- full of interesting little info, like employee names
- helpful for locating dates and places (as much as payments)
- already physical
- I'm imagining a little pouch
- periodically, they're impaled onto two spikes aka the receipt holder
  - could insert labels/markers between chunks for easier scanning later
- periodically, they're bound and compressed (physically)
  - rolled? flattened? vacuumed?

- opt into gameplay
- starts out simple, just the story
- if you never touch it, it will run
- invited to experiment and play
- you invite new ways of experiencing and playing with the world
- more layers are added

- imagine a literal storybook
- simpler and more obvious interfaces + choices
- modular and layered
- an opportunity pops up (like a pull storybook)
- easier to produce image assets
  - can photograph or use a digital a physical drawing and use
  - import + process arbitrary images
  - can use any art program (to process pixels)
  - computer tools to edit
  - eventually, develop internal model and provide api
    - api : {connectors,modules,plugins,interface,translators,constructors}

- intentions as daemons
  - "devil and angel on shoulder"
  - provide opportunities
  - short lived, opportunities must be grabbed
  - may have conditions attached, need to weigh them quickly
- conditions become more complex and dangerous
  - need to intuitively assess risk
  - like fairy packs
  - unintended consequences

- i'm trying to improve the library page
- i want to separate the catalog data from the text
- i want to add filters and controls to the table
  - i want to create admin tools
  - the admin tools are just tools, except fancy
  - provide default simple tool set as a preset config

weaving and growing (cultivating) of opportunities
but the opportunities are largely out of your control
based on luck, fate, circumstance

only allowed to draw ephemeral maps (on transitory objects or with degrading like chalk)
