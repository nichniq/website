A lot of stuff is just text. That's defined in blocks like this. Blocks are
separated by empty lines.

- Lists are common
- Lists also get a simple notation
- For anything more complex, we need blocks

===
    Blocks are surrounded with an opener/closer and can contain more than one node. Their content is indented

    If the type is not specified, it will interpret content as it would outside
    of a block. (That is, we have text and lists.)

=== text
    Blocks may add additional information to help describe them.
--- list
    - Blocks are labeled with their type (text, list)
    - Blocks are contained with outer delimiters (===)
    - Blocks may be subdivided (---)
    - Blocks may received metadata (^^^)
--- text
    This lets us group complex nodes together into a single block.

There are some special, built-in structures: lists, maps, and sets.

=== []
    - Pack books
    - Go through clothes, pack or discard
    - Organize trinkets
---
    - Lists can use the "list" type
    - The shorthand for "list" is "[]"

    ordering: sequential
===

=== {}
    1 -> 2
    2 -> 4
    3 -> 8
    4 -> 16
    5 -> 32
---
    - Maps use "->" to provide a mapping from the left side to the right
    - The ordering doesn't matter
    - They use the "{}" shorthand

=== <>
    - Labyrinth
    - Fates
    - One way through
    - Intestines
    - Twists and turns
    - Eventuality
    - Process
---
    - Sets use the "<>" shorthand
    - Sets are underordered and should not have repeated elements
