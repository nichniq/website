                        In 2011, I typeset the second edition of <cite data-medium="anthology">Aiki Waza Michi Shirube (Aikido Practice is a Signpost to the Way): Selected Essays on Aikido and Nonviolent Interaction</cite> by Donald N. Levine. To me, he was Don Sensei. He was my aikido teacher at the University at Chicago for several years, and for much of that time, I was his personal assistant.

                    <p>
                        One of my projects for him was to format this collection of his essays about aikido. I was diligently open source back then, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to learn <i class="small-caps">LaTeX</i>. Although I completed the artifact, I can't say that I retained any of what I learned. Looking at the source code today, I couldn't tell you how to read any of it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I have a lot more to write about aikido and my relationship with Don Sensei, but that'll have to come later. Working on this document together resulted in a significant fracture in our relationship that never healed before his death in 2015. Dr. Levine was an impressive man and I learned a lot from him.
